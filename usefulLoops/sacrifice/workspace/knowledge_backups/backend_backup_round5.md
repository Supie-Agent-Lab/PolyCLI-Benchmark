## Section 1: System Startup, Shutdown, and Process Integrity

This section covers fundamental patterns for starting, stopping, and maintaining the integrity of system services and processes. Adhering to these patterns prevents common errors related to initialization order, process lifecycle management, and cross-version compatibility.

### The "Parent Initializer First" Pattern

This pattern ensures that parent class attributes are correctly initialized before any child-class logic attempts to use them, preventing `AttributeError` or `NameError` exceptions during object instantiation.

**Problem:** When a child class `__init__` method performs its own initializations before calling the parent's `__init__` (via `super()`), it may attempt to access attributes that do not yet exist.

**Example (Incorrect Code):**

```python
class BaseService:
    def __init__(self):
        print("BaseService: Initializing...")
        self.config = {"port": 8080, "host": "localhost"}
        self.service_name = "base_service"
        print("BaseService: Initialization complete.")

class WebService(BaseService):
    def __init__(self, service_name_override):
        # Problem: Accessing self.service_name before it is set by BaseService.__init__()
        print(f"WebService: Overriding service name from '{self.service_name}' to '{service_name_override}'.")
        self.service_name_override = service_name_override

        # Parent initializer is called last
        super().__init__()

# Attempting to instantiate the class will fail
try:
    ws = WebService("my_web_service")
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"\nError: {e}")
```

**Error Message and Analysis:**

Running the code above results in an `AttributeError` because `WebService.__init__` tries to access `self.service_name` before `super().__init__()` has been called to create it.

```
WebService: Overriding service name from '{self.service_name}' to 'my_web_service'.

Error: 'WebService' object has no attribute 'service_name'
```

**Solution:** Always call `super().__init__()` as the *first* statement in a child class's `__init__` method. This guarantees that the parent's state is fully initialized and available to the child.

**Example (Corrected Code):**

```python
class BaseService:
    def __init__(self):
        print("BaseService: Initializing...")
        self.config = {"port": 8080, "host": "localhost"}
        self.service_name = "base_service"
        print("BaseService: Initialization complete.")

class WebService(BaseService):
    def __init__(self, service_name_override):
        # Solution: Call parent initializer first
        super().__init__()

        # Now, parent attributes are available and can be safely accessed or modified
        print(f"WebService: Overriding service name from '{self.service_name}' to '{service_name_override}'.")
        self.service_name = service_name_override

# Instantiation now succeeds
ws = WebService("my_web_service")
print(f"\nSuccessfully created service: {ws.service_name}")
```

### The "Detached Subprocess Invocation" Pattern

This pattern is critical for launching long-running background processes or performing graceful service restarts. It ensures that a child process is fully detached from its parent, preventing it from being terminated when the parent exits or from hanging due to terminal control issues.

**Problem:** When a script launches a subprocess and then exits, the child process might be killed by the shell or operating system. Furthermore, if a background process attempts to read from standard input (`stdin`), it will receive a `SIGTTIN` signal, causing it to hang indefinitely.

**Solution:** Use `subprocess.Popen` with specific arguments to create a new, independent process session and sever standard I/O streams.

*   `start_new_session=True`: This is the key argument. It runs the command in a new session, making it the leader of a new process group. This detaches it from the parent's control terminal, so it won't be killed when the parent's session ends.
*   Redirect `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`: To prevent the `SIGTTIN` hang and avoid broken pipe errors, redirect standard I/O streams to `os.devnull` (or `subprocess.DEVNULL`).

**Example (Corrected Code):**

This script launches a background task that will continue running even after the main script has exited.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys
import time

def launch_detached_process(command):
    """
    Launches a command as a fully detached process.
    """
    print(f"Parent (PID: {os.getpid()}): Launching detached process...")

    # On Windows, start_new_session is not available.
    # DETACHED_PROCESS creation flag is used instead, which is the default
    # behavior for Popen without shell=True, so no special handling is needed.
    # The I/O redirection is still crucial.
    kwargs = {}
    if sys.platform != "win32":
        kwargs['start_new_session'] = True

    # Redirect standard file descriptors to /dev/null
    # This is critical to prevent the SIGTTIN hang
    p = subprocess.Popen(
        command,
        stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL,
        stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL,
        stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
        close_fds=True, # Close all file descriptors except 0, 1, 2
        **kwargs
    )

    print(f"Parent: Launched process with PID: {p.pid}. Parent is now exiting.")

# Example usage:
# Create a simple command that writes to a file to prove it's running
command_to_run = [sys.executable, '-c', "import time; f = open('output.txt', 'w'); f.write('Process started\\n'); f.flush(); time.sleep(10); f.write('Process finished\\n'); f.close()"]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    launch_detached_process(command_to_run)
    time.sleep(2) # Give the parent a moment before exiting
    # After this script exits, check for 'output.txt' and monitor the process list.
    # The child process will continue running for its full 10-second duration.
```

### Backward-Compatible ThreadPoolExecutor Shutdown

This pattern ensures that code using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` runs correctly on both modern (3.9+) and older Python versions.

**Problem:** The `cancel_futures` keyword argument was added to `ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown()` in Python 3.9. Calling `shutdown(cancel_futures=True)` on Python 3.8 or earlier will raise a `TypeError`, crashing the application during its shutdown sequence.

**Error Message (on Python < 3.9):**

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "my_app.py", line 10, in a_function
    executor.shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=True)
TypeError: shutdown() got an unexpected keyword argument 'cancel_futures'
```

**Solution:** Wrap the shutdown call in a `try...except TypeError` block. The `try` block attempts the modern, preferred method. If a `TypeError` occurs, the `except` block falls back to the legacy method, ensuring compatibility.

**Example (Corrected Code):**

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time
import sys

def run_tasks():
    print(f"Running on Python version: {sys.version}")
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        # Submit tasks that may run for a while
        executor.submit(time.sleep, 3)
        executor.submit(time.sleep, 3)

        print("Tasks submitted. Shutting down executor...")

        # Robust shutdown logic
        try:
            # Python 3.9+ syntax
            print("Attempting shutdown with 'cancel_futures=True' (Python 3.9+)...")
            executor.shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=True)
        except TypeError:
            # Fallback for Python < 3.9
            print("Caught TypeError, falling back to legacy shutdown (Python < 3.9)...")
            executor.shutdown(wait=True)

    print("Executor shutdown complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_tasks()
```

This approach is highly robust because it directly handles the exact error caused by the version incompatibility, rather than relying on less precise Python version checks (e.g., `if sys.version_info >= (3, 9)`).

## Section 2: Firmware (C++) Critical Patterns for Real-Time Operations

This section documents critical C++ patterns and rules enforced in the firmware to ensure real-time performance, display consistency, and system stability. Adherence to these patterns is mandatory for all contributions.

### 1. The Fixed-Beat Loop for Real-Time Tasks

**The Problem:** Real-time processes, especially the audio processing task, must execute at a precise and consistent interval. Using a standard delay like `vTaskDelay()` introduces jitter, as it only guarantees a *minimum* delay. The task's own execution time adds to the total loop duration, causing the period to drift and accumulate error over time. This jitter results in audible artifacts such as clicks, pops, and distorted audio.

**A Flawed Approach (Causes Jitter):**

```cpp
// DO NOT USE THIS PATTERN FOR REAL-TIME LOOPS
// This loop will take AT LEAST 2ms, plus the time to execute do_audio_processing().
// The actual period will be inconsistent, leading to audio jitter.
void audio_processing_task(void *pvParameters) {
    for (;;) {
        do_audio_processing(); // e.g., takes 0.5ms
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(2)); // Delays for 2ms
        // Total loop time is ~2.5ms, not 2ms!
    }
}
```

**The Correct Pattern (`vTaskDelayUntil`):**

The only acceptable method for implementing a fixed-frequency task is to use the FreeRTOS function `vTaskDelayUntil()`. This function calculates the exact number of ticks to wait to meet an absolute deadline, automatically compensating for the time the task has already spent executing. This creates a "fixed-beat" or "phase-correct" loop.

Our audio processing task **must** run at a precise 2ms period (500 Hz).

**Implementation Example:**

```cpp
#include "freertos/FreeRTOS.h"
#include "freertos/task.h"

// The required frequency for our audio processing task.
#define AUDIO_TASK_PERIOD_MS 2
const TickType_t xAudioTaskFrequency = pdMS_TO_TICKS(AUDIO_TASK_PERIOD_MS);

// The main loop for the audio processing task.
void audio_processing_task(void *pvParameters) {
    // Variable to hold the last wake time. Must be initialized with the
    // current time before the loop starts.
    TickType_t xLastWakeTime;
    xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();

    // The fixed-beat real-time loop.
    for (;;) {
        // 1. Wait for the next cycle.
        // This call blocks until the absolute time (xLastWakeTime + xAudioTaskFrequency) is reached.
        vTaskDelayUntil(&xLastWakeTime, xAudioTaskFrequency);

        // 2. Perform the time-sensitive work.
        // This code now runs at a precise, consistent 500Hz frequency.
        process_audio_samples();
        update_dac_buffer();
    }
}
```

### 2. E-Ink Display Rendering Rules

To prevent visual bugs and ensure consistent display updates, the following rules for rendering on the E-Ink screen using the `U8g2` library are mandatory.

#### Rule 2.1: Use `drawUTF8()` instead of `print()`

**The Problem:** The `u8g2_->print()` function, inherited from the Arduino `Print` class, is deprecated for this project. It has known issues with character encoding, font rendering, and positioning, leading to inconsistent or incorrect text display, especially with our custom fonts.

**The Solution:** Always use `u8g2_->drawUTF8()` for all string and text rendering. It is the library's native function and provides reliable, pixel-perfect positioning and correct UTF-8 character support.

**Implementation Example:**

```cpp
// In any display rendering function:
// u8g2_->setFont(u8g2_font_helvB10_tr);

// WRONG: Deprecated, causes positioning and encoding issues.
// u8g2_->setCursor(5, 15);
// u8g2_->print("Status: OK");

// CORRECT: Ensures accurate rendering and character support.
u8g2_->drawUTF8(5, 15, "Status: OK");
```

#### Rule 2.2: The Stateful Color Rendering Pattern

**The Problem:** We identified a recurring and difficult-to-trace bug where text and graphics would intermittently fail to render, appearing as "white-on-white". This occurs because the `U8g2` library's color state can be unexpectedly reset, particularly after partial screen updates or other system events. Assuming the color state is preserved between drawing blocks is unsafe.

**The Solution:** You **must** explicitly set the foreground and background colors before every logical block of drawing commands. Never assume the color state is correct. This pattern completely eliminates the "white-on-white" bug.

**Implementation Example:**

```cpp
void render_display_screen() {
    u8g2_->clearBuffer();

    // --- BAD: Assumes color state is preserved ---
    /*
    u8g2_->setForegroundColor(U8G2_BLACK);   // Set once at the beginning
    u8g2_->setBackgroundColor(U8G2_WHITE);

    // Block 1: Draw status bar
    draw_status_bar_elements(); // If this function or another interrupt alters colors, the next block will fail.

    // Block 2: Draw main content
    draw_main_content();        // This might draw white-on-white if the color state was lost.
    */


    // --- CORRECT: The Stateful Color Rendering Pattern ---

    // Block 1: Draw the Status Bar
    u8g2_->setForegroundColor(U8G2_BLACK);
    u8g2_->setBackgroundColor(U8G2_WHITE);
    u8g2_->setFont(u8g2_font_profont11_mf);
    u8g2_->drawUTF8(5, 12, "WIFI: Connected");
    u8g2_->drawHLine(0, 15, 128);


    // Block 2: Draw the Main Content Area
    // Re-assert the color state before this new logical block.
    u8g2_->setForegroundColor(U8G2_BLACK);
    u8g2_->setBackgroundColor(U8G2_WHITE);
    u8g2_->setFont(u8g2_font_logisoso24_tr);
    u8g2_->drawUTF8(10, 50, "IDLE");


    u8g2_->sendBuffer();
}

```

### 3. The Thin Receive Thread Pattern for WebSocket Stability

**The Problem:** Performing complex operations like JSON parsing, file I/O, or extensive state machine updates directly within the WebSocket event callback thread is dangerous. This thread has a limited stack and is responsible for maintaining the health of the connection (e.g., responding to `ping` requests). Heavy processing can block this thread, leading to connection timeouts and drops. More critically, complex parsing can easily exhaust the task's stack, causing a silent crash and device reboot.

*   **Observed Failure Mode:** Device reboots with `Guru Meditation Error: Core 1 panic'd (Stack canary watchpoint triggered)`. This indicates a stack overflow in a task, traced back to the WebSocket client task trying to parse a large JSON message.

**The Correct Pattern:** The WebSocket receive thread must be kept "thin". Its sole responsibility is to receive data, perform minimal inspection, and queue the data for processing on a different task (e.g., the main application task). The only exception is the initial `hello` message, which is small and required for immediate session setup.

**Implementation Example:**

This pattern requires a FreeRTOS `QueueHandle_t` to be shared between the WebSocket task and the main application task.

```cpp
// main.cpp - Simplified setup
#include "freertos/queue.h"

// A queue to hold incoming WebSocket messages for deferred processing.
QueueHandle_t g_webSocketMessageQueue;

void setup() {
    // Create a queue that can hold up to 10 pointers to char arrays.
    g_webSocketMessageQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(char*));
    // ... initialize WiFi, WebSocket client, and other tasks
}


// websocket_callbacks.cpp - The thin receive thread logic
void webSocketClientEvent(WStype_t type, uint8_t * payload, size_t length) {
    switch (type) {
        case WStype_DISCONNECTED:
            ESP_LOGI("WS", "Disconnected!");
            break;

        case WStype_CONNECTED:
            ESP_LOGI("WS", "Connected to url: %s", payload);
            break;

        case WStype_TEXT:
            // The Thin Receive Pattern in action
            if (strncmp((char *)payload, "{\"type\":\"hello\"", 14) == 0) {
                // EXCEPTION: 'hello' is small and critical, process it immediately.
                handle_hello_message((char *)payload);
            } else {
                // ALL OTHER MESSAGES: Queue them for the main loop.
                // 1. Allocate memory for the message. THE RECEIVING TASK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FREEING IT.
                char* payload_copy = (char*)malloc(length + 1);
                if (payload_copy != NULL) {
                    memcpy(payload_copy, payload, length);
                    payload_copy[length] = '\0';

                    // 2. Send the pointer to the main task via the queue.
                    if (xQueueSend(g_webSocketMessageQueue, &payload_copy, pdMS_TO_TICKS(10)) != pdTRUE) {
                        ESP_LOGE("WS", "Failed to queue message. Queue full!");
                        free(payload_copy); // Avoid memory leak if queueing fails.
                    }
                } else {
                    ESP_LOGE("WS", "Failed to allocate memory for message payload!");
                }
            }
            break;

        // ... other cases like PONG, BINARY, etc.
    }
}


// main.cpp - The main application task, which does the heavy lifting.
void main_application_task(void* pvParameters) {
    char* received_message_ptr = NULL;

    for (;;) {
        // Wait for a message to appear in the queue.
        if (xQueueReceive(g_webSocketMessageQueue, &received_message_ptr, portMAX_DELAY) == pdPASS) {
            if (received_message_ptr != NULL) {
                // Now we are in the context of the main task, which has a larger stack
                // and where blocking is less critical to network health.
                ESP_LOGI("Main", "Dequeued message: %s", received_message_ptr);
                
                // Perform heavy JSON parsing and state updates here.
                parse_and_process_complex_message(received_message_ptr);

                // CRITICAL: Free the memory that was allocated in the WebSocket callback.
                free(received_message_ptr);
                received_message_ptr = NULL;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Section 3: Hardware-Backend Communication Protocol

### Message Framing
All communication over the TCP socket is message-based. Each message, whether JSON control data or binary audio data, is prefixed with a **4-byte unsigned integer** representing the payload length in network byte order (big-endian).

**Structure:** `[ 4-byte big-endian length ][ payload ]`

This framing is critical. It allows the receiver (firmware or backend) to read the exact number of bytes for the payload without needing special delimiters or parsers that scan for terminators.

*   **Firmware C++ Implementation Detail:** The firmware must first read exactly 4 bytes from the socket, convert the bytes from network to host byte order (e.g., using the `ntohl` function), and then read that specific number of bytes to get the complete payload.

*   **Python Backend Example (Sending a message):**
    ```python
    import json
    import struct

    def send_message(sock, payload_data):
        """Encodes and sends a message with a 4-byte length prefix."""
        if isinstance(payload_data, dict):
            # It's a JSON control message
            payload_bytes = json.dumps(payload_data).encode('utf-8')
        else:
            # It's a binary data chunk
            payload_bytes = payload_data

        # Pack length as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer
        len_prefix = struct.pack('>I', len(payload_bytes))
        
        # Send prefix followed by payload
        sock.sendall(len_prefix + payload_bytes)
    ```

### Connection Initialization and The `hello` Message
Upon a successful TCP connection from the hardware device, the Python backend immediately sends a `hello` message. This message provides the firmware with the essential configuration parameters for audio processing. The firmware **must not** send any data until it has received and parsed this initial message.

The `hello` message is a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "audio_params": {
    "format": "opus",
    "sample_rate": 24000,
    "channels": 1,
    "frame_duration": 60
  }
}
```

#### `audio_params` Dictionary Details
This dictionary is critical for initializing the C++ audio decoder on the firmware. Any deviation from these parameters will lead to decoding errors or poor audio quality.

*   **`format`** (string): Specifies the audio codec.
    *   **Value:** `"opus"`
    *   **Description:** The firmware must use the libopus decoder. No other formats are currently supported.

*   **`sample_rate`** (integer): The sampling rate of the audio in Hertz.
    *   **Value:** `24000`
    *   **Description:** The Opus decoder must be initialized to expect 24kHz wide-band audio. This value was chosen as the optimal balance between voice synthesis quality and bandwidth.

*   **`channels`** (integer): The number of audio channels.
    *   **Value:** `1`
    *   **Description:** All audio is mono. The decoder must be initialized for a single channel.

*   **`frame_duration`** (integer): The duration of a single audio frame in milliseconds.
    *   **Value:** `60`
    *   **Description:** This is a **critical, non-negotiable parameter**. The backend's TTS engine generates Opus frames, each containing exactly 60ms of audio. The firmware's decoder and audio buffer management logic must be configured for this specific duration.
    *   **Technical Rationale:** A 60ms frame duration at a 24000 Hz sample rate results in a frame size of `(24000 samples/sec) * (0.060 sec) = 1440 samples`. This is a standard and efficient frame size supported by the Opus codec.
    *   **Firmware Error Condition:** If the Opus decoder is initialized with a different frame size (e.g., 20ms or 40ms), it will fail to process the incoming 60ms frames from the backend. The `opus_decode()` function will likely return an `OPUS_INVALID_PACKET` error, resulting in a complete failure to play audio.

### TTS Audio Streaming Control Flow
Playing a text-to-speech phrase is a well-defined three-stage process. The firmware transitions between a state of listening for JSON commands and a state of decoding a binary audio stream.

#### Stage 1: Start TTS (`start` message)
To initiate audio playback, the backend sends a `tts` control message with a `state` of `start`.

**JSON Payload:**
```json
{"type": "tts", "state": "start"}
```

**Firmware Action:** Upon receiving this message, the firmware must:
1.  Prepare its audio pipeline for playback (e.g., power up the DAC, open the I2S audio interface, reset audio buffers).
2.  Switch its socket listening logic from "JSON command mode" to "binary stream mode". It should now expect a sequence of length-prefixed binary Opus frames.

#### Stage 2: Binary Opus Stream
Immediately following the `start` message, the backend sends a continuous stream of binary data. Each message in this stream is a single, complete Opus audio frame, framed with its own 4-byte length prefix.

**Message Structure:** `[ 4-byte length ][ binary opus frame data ]`

*   **Example:** A typical 60ms silent Opus frame might be very small, while a complex one could be over 100 bytes. The firmware might see a sequence like this on the wire:
    *   `[0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x7A]` (122 bytes) followed by 122 bytes of Opus data.
    *   `[0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x6E]` (110 bytes) followed by 110 bytes of Opus data.
    *   ...and so on for the duration of the phrase.

**Firmware Action:** For each received binary message:
1.  Read the 4-byte length and then the binary payload.
2.  Pass the payload (the raw Opus frame data) to the initialized `opus_decode()` function.
3.  Write the resulting decoded PCM audio data to the output audio buffer for the DAC/I2S peripheral.
4.  Loop this process, continuing to read length-prefixed binary chunks.

#### Stage 3: Stop TTS (`stop` message)
Once all audio frames have been sent, the backend sends a final `tts` control message with a `state` of `stop` to terminate the stream. This message signals the transition back to command mode.

**JSON Payload:**
```json
{"type": "tts", "state": "stop"}
```

**Firmware Action:** Upon receiving this message, the firmware must:
1.  Stop playback and gracefully shut down the audio pipeline. It should ensure any remaining audio in its DMA buffers is played out to avoid an audible click.
2.  Switch its socket listening logic back to "JSON command mode," ready to receive the next command (e.g., another `tts` request).

### System Messages: The Dual-Channel Transition
The backend enforces a "single active connection" policy per device. If a device reconnects while an old connection is still technically open (e.g., due to a brief network interruption where TCP keepalives have not yet timed out), the backend performs a "Dual-Channel Transition" to manage the handover cleanly.

**Scenario:**
1.  Device `ESP32-XYZ` is connected via `Connection-1`.
2.  The device resets or loses connectivity and establishes `Connection-2`.
3.  The backend accepts `Connection-2` as the new, authoritative connection for `ESP32-XYZ`.
4.  To prevent `Connection-1` from becoming a stale, "zombie" connection, the backend sends a terminal `system` message to it before forcefully closing the socket from the server side.

**Notification Payload:**
This `system` message is sent exclusively to the **old connection** (`Connection-1`) to inform it of the impending, server-initiated disconnection.

```json
{
  "type": "system",
  "message": "New connection established. This connection is being superseded and will be closed."
}
```

**Firmware Action:**
While the firmware is not required to parse the `message` string, it must recognize the `"type": "system"` message. This serves as a definitive signal that the connection is no longer valid. The recommended firmware behavior is to immediately close its end of the socket and transition to a reconnection logic state, rather than waiting for a TCP read to fail or time out. This ensures faster and more predictable recovery from state inconsistencies.

## Section 4: Backend State Management and Asynchronous Patterns

### Stateful Idle Timeout and TTS Liveliness

To prevent stale or abandoned WebSocket connections from consuming server resources indefinitely, a stateful idle timeout mechanism is implemented. A connection is considered idle if no messages are received from the client for a predefined period (e.g., 60 seconds). However, a standard idle timeout poses a problem for our application: during Text-to-Speech (TTS) playback, the server is streaming audio data *to* the client, but the client is not sending any messages *to* the server. This would normally trigger a false positive idle disconnect, terminating the connection while the user is actively listening.

To solve this, we use a stateful boolean flag, `client_is_speaking`, associated with each connection's state.

**Mechanism:**

1.  **Flag Set:** Immediately before the backend begins streaming TTS audio data to the client, it sets `self.client_is_speaking = True` in the connection's handler state.
2.  **Timeout Check:** The idle timeout logic, which runs periodically, checks for message activity. Crucially, it also checks the value of `self.client_is_speaking`. If this flag is `True`, the timeout logic is bypassed for that connection, even if no messages have been received from the client.
3.  **Flag Unset:** Once the TTS audio stream has been completely sent, the backend immediately resets the flag to `self.client_is_speaking = False`. This resumes the normal idle timeout monitoring.

**Code Example (Conceptual):**

This snippet illustrates the core logic within a connection handler class.

```python
class ConnectionHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client_is_speaking = False
        self.last_message_time = time.time()

    async def handle_tts_request(self, text_to_speak):
        # 1. Set the flag before starting the stream
        self.client_is_speaking = True
        print("INFO: TTS playback started. Pausing idle timeout.")
        
        try:
            # Simulate streaming audio chunks to the client
            audio_stream = await tts_service.generate_audio(text_to_speak)
            for chunk in audio_stream:
                await websocket.send(chunk)
        finally:
            # 3. Unset the flag after the stream is finished, even if an error occurs
            self.client_is_speaking = False
            print("INFO: TTS playback finished. Resuming idle timeout.")
            # Update last message time to reset the timer from now
            self.last_message_time = time.time()

    async def check_idle_timeout(self):
        # 2. Check the flag during the periodic timeout check
        if self.client_is_speaking:
            # Do not disconnect, client is actively listening to TTS
            return

        if (time.time() - self.last_message_time) > 60:
            print("ERROR: Connection timed out due to inactivity.")
            await websocket.close()
```

**Common Issues & Fixes:**

*   **Issue:** Connection drops during long TTS monologues.
*   **Cause:** The `client_is_speaking` flag was not set, or was reset prematurely.
*   **Solution:** Ensure the `try...finally` block is correctly used so that `self.client_is_speaking = False` is *always* called after the TTS streaming completes or fails.

### Asynchronous Save-on-Close Pattern

Writing dialogue summaries to the filesystem upon connection closure is a blocking I/O operation. Performing this directly in the main `asyncio` event loop would halt the entire server, preventing it from handling other concurrent clients until the file write is complete. This leads to poor performance and unresponsiveness.

To avoid this, we offload the blocking I/O to a separate, dedicated `threading.Thread`. The key challenge is that `asyncio` coroutines cannot be directly run in a new thread without a running event loop. The solution is to create a *new* event loop specifically for that worker thread.

**Pattern Steps:**

1.  **Trigger:** The `on_disconnect` method of the WebSocket handler is called.
2.  **Data Capture:** It gathers the necessary data for the summary (e.g., last user message, last assistant message).
3.  **Thread Offload:** Instead of writing the file directly, it spawns a new `threading.Thread`. The target of this thread is a worker function.
4.  **Worker Function:**
    *   This function creates a completely new `asyncio` event loop using `asyncio.new_event_loop()`.
    *   It sets this new loop as the current event loop for the thread using `asyncio.set_event_loop()`.
    *   It then calls `loop.run_until_complete()` to execute the `async` function responsible for the actual file writing.
5.  **Main Loop Unblocked:** The main event loop, having spent negligible time spawning the thread, immediately returns to handling other active connections.

**Code Example:**

```python
import asyncio
import threading
import aiofiles  # For async file I/O

# This function runs in the context of the main asyncio loop (e.g., on_disconnect)
def save_dialogue_in_background(summary_data: dict):
    """Spawns a new thread to handle the save operation asynchronously."""
    save_thread = threading.Thread(
        target=_save_worker,
        args=(summary_data,)
    )
    save_thread.start()
    print(f"INFO: Offloaded save operation to thread {save_thread.name}.")

# This is the target for the new thread
def _save_worker(summary_data: dict):
    """Creates a new event loop in this thread to run the async save function."""
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(_async_save_dialogue(summary_data))
    finally:
        loop.close()

# This is the async function that performs the actual I/O
async def _async_save_dialogue(summary_data: dict):
    """Performs the non-blocking file write."""
    file_path = f"./logs/{summary_data['session_id']}.txt"
    content = summary_data['content']
    
    async with aiofiles.open(file_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        await f.write(content)
    print(f"INFO: Dialogue summary successfully saved to {file_path}.")

# --- In the WebSocket Handler ---
# async def on_disconnect(self, close_code):
#     summary = generate_summary_string(...)
#     summary_data = {'session_id': self.session_id, 'content': summary}
#     save_dialogue_in_background(summary_data)
```

**Common Issues & Fixes:**

*   **Error Message:** `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'Thread-X'.`
*   **Cause:** Attempting to run an `async` function inside a new thread without first creating and setting an event loop for that thread.
*   **Solution:** Ensure the worker function explicitly calls `asyncio.new_event_loop()` and `asyncio.set_event_loop()` before trying to run any coroutines.

### Automatic Dialogue Summary Generation

Upon the closure of every WebSocket connection (either by client disconnect or server-side timeout), a concise summary of the final exchange is automatically generated and logged. This provides a quick, human-readable record of the interaction for debugging, analysis, and quality assurance. This summary is the content that is saved using the 'Asynchronous Save-on-Close' pattern.

**Summary Format:**

The summary string is formatted with meticulous precision. It captures the owner's name, the user's last message, and the assistant's final response in a single line.

*   **Exact Format String:** `'{Owner Name}: {User Text} / 喵喵同学: {Assistant Text}'`

**Data Sourcing:**

*   `{Owner Name}`: A static value representing the bot's owner or branding (e.g., "BOb").
*   `{User Text}`: The full text from the last message received from the user. This is stored in the connection's state.
*   `喵喵同学`: This is the hardcoded name of the AI assistant.
*   `{Assistant Text}`: The full text of the assistant's last generated response, which was sent back to the user (and potentially used for TTS). This is also stored in the connection's state.

**Example Generation and Output:**

Let's assume the following state at the time of disconnect:
*   Owner Name: `BOb`
*   Last User Text: `今天天气怎么样？` (How is the weather today?)
*   Last Assistant Text: `今天天气晴朗，非常适合出门活动。` (The weather is sunny today, very suitable for outdoor activities.)

The generated summary string logged to the console and saved to the file would be:

```
BOb: 今天天气怎么样？ / 喵喵同学: 今天天气晴朗，非常适合出门活动。
```

**Code Snippet (Conceptual):**

This logic would typically reside in a helper function called by the `on_disconnect` handler.

```python
def generate_dialogue_summary(state: dict) -> str:
    """Formats the final exchange into the standard summary string."""
    
    owner_name = "BOb" # Could be from config
    assistant_name = "喵喵同学" # Hardcoded assistant persona
    
    # Retrieve last messages from the connection state
    # Use default values to prevent errors if a conversation never started
    user_text = state.get("last_user_message", "[No user message]")
    assistant_text = state.get("last_assistant_response", "[No assistant response]")
    
    # The exact format string
    summary = f"{owner_name}: {user_text} / {assistant_name}: {assistant_text}"
    
    return summary
```

## Section 5: Dynamic Configuration and Resource Management

The system employs a dynamic approach to configuration and resource management, ensuring efficient use of memory and CPU. Key components are loaded on-demand rather than at startup, and system behavior can be adapted based on configuration files without requiring a code change.

### The Lazy-Loading LLM Cache (`get_llm_for`)

To prevent the significant memory overhead of loading multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) at startup, we use a lazy-loading pattern. An LLM is only instantiated the first time it is requested by an agent. Once loaded, it is cached in memory for subsequent requests. The central function for this mechanism is `llm_manager.get_llm_for(agent_config)`.

#### LLM Lookup Fallback Chain

`get_llm_for` uses a flexible fallback chain to determine which LLM to load for a given agent. It inspects the agent's configuration dictionary in a specific order. The first valid key found determines the model. This allows for both specific overrides and general defaults.

The lookup order is:
1.  **`alias`**: A specific, unique identifier for a pre-configured LLM instance. This is the highest priority and is used to assign a specific, fine-tuned, or uniquely configured model to an agent.
2.  **`name`**: A descriptive name for a model (e.g., `"gpt-4o-mini"`). If multiple agents use the same `name`, they will share the same cached LLM instance.
3.  **`module`**: The Python module class for the LLM (e.g., `GPT4o`). This is used to request a default instance of a specific model type.
4.  **`llm`**: The generic base model type (e.g., `"openai"`). This is used to request a default model from a specific provider.

#### Default Fallback Logic

If the agent's configuration contains none of the above keys, the system falls back to the `default_llm` key specified in the main `config.yaml`. This ensures that every agent will be assigned a functional LLM even with minimal configuration.

#### Configuration Example (`agents.yaml`)

This example demonstrates the fallback chain in action.

```yaml
# agents.yaml
agents:
  - agent_id: code_reviewer
    # Highest priority: Uses a specifically tuned model instance named 'code-linter-fine-tune'.
    # get_llm_for will first look for this alias.
    config:
      alias: "code-linter-fine-tune"
      prompt: "Review the following code for errors..."

  - agent_id: creative_writer
    # No alias, so it falls back to 'name'. It will load and cache "gpt-4-turbo".
    config:
      name: "gpt-4-turbo"
      prompt: "Write a short story about..."

  - agent_id: data_analyzer
    # No alias or name, so it falls back to 'module'. It gets a default instance of the 'Claude3Sonnet' class.
    config:
      module: "Claude3Sonnet"
      prompt: "Analyze this dataset..."

  - agent_id: general_assistant
    # No alias, name, or module. It falls back to 'llm', getting the default model for the 'openai' provider.
    config:
      llm: "openai"
      prompt: "You are a helpful assistant."

  - agent_id: minimalist_agent
    # No LLM keys at all. This agent will receive the system's `default_llm` from config.yaml.
    config:
      prompt: "Default behavior."
```

#### Common Errors and Solutions

-   **Error Message:** `LLMResolutionError: Could not resolve LLM for agent 'data_analyzer'. No matching LLM found for config and no default_llm is set.`
-   **Cause:** The agent's configuration did not match any known LLMs, and the main `config.yaml` is missing the `default_llm` setting.
-   **Solution:** Ensure a `default_llm` is defined in `config.yaml` to act as a universal fallback.

    ```yaml
    # In config.yaml
    default_llm: "gpt-4o-mini"
    ```

### ASR Instantiation Strategy

The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) service is a critical resource. Its instantiation strategy depends on its type, which is defined in `config.yaml` under the `asr.type` key.

-   **`LOCAL` ASR (Singleton Pattern):**
    -   When `asr.type` is set to `LOCAL`, the system uses a local engine like Whisper. These models are resource-intensive.
    -   **Strategy:** A single instance of the ASR engine is created at startup and shared across all components that require transcription. This is a classic Singleton pattern.
    -   **Reasoning:** This approach conserves significant memory and CPU by avoiding the re-loading of a multi-gigabyte model for each new audio stream.

-   **`REMOTE` ASR (Instance-per-Connection Pattern):**
    -   When `asr.type` is set to `REMOTE`, the system uses a cloud-based service (e.g., Deepgram, AssemblyAI) via a WebSocket or API.
    -   **Strategy:** A new client instance is created for each independent audio connection (e.g., for each new participant joining a call).
    -   **Reasoning:** Remote service clients are lightweight and often manage connection-specific state (like authentication tokens, session IDs, and stream buffers). Isolating instances prevents state-related conflicts and makes the system more robust, as an error in one connection's client won't affect others.

### Conditional Feature Loading for System Modes

The system can enable or disable entire features by checking for specific keys in `config.yaml`. This is used to create different operational "modes" without altering the codebase.

A prime example is the **Meeting Mode**, where the system should listen and process conversations but not speak.

#### How It Works

To enable this mode, add the `disable_tts: true` key to your `config.yaml`.

**Configuration Example (`config.yaml`):**

```yaml
# config.yaml

# This configuration enables 'Meeting Mode'. The system will listen and transcribe
# but the Text-to-Speech (TTS) service will not be loaded, preventing any audible output.
meeting_mode:
  disable_tts: true

asr:
  type: REMOTE
  provider: deepgram
  # ... other ASR settings
```

When the system boots, the `tts_manager` checks for this key. If `disable_tts` is `true`, it completely bypasses the initialization of the TTS service handler.

**Benefits:**
1.  **Resource Savings:** The TTS model and its dependencies are never loaded into memory.
2.  **Safety:** Guarantees silence from the system, which is critical in a meeting transcription scenario.
3.  **Flexibility:** The same codebase can be deployed in an interactive conversational mode or a passive listening mode simply by changing a configuration flag.

### Adaptive UI via Device-Specific Configuration

The user interface must adapt to various display sizes, from small embedded touchscreens to large desktop monitors. This is managed by externalizing display properties into a `devices.yaml` file. The `get_lines_per_page` function is a key part of this system.

#### The `get_lines_per_page` Function

This utility function determines how many lines of text (e.g., conversation history) should be displayed on a single screen page to avoid scrolling or cramped text.

**Mechanism:**
1.  At startup, the system identifies the device it's running on, typically via its hostname.
2.  When a UI component needs to render a list of items, it calls `ui_utils.get_lines_per_page()`.
3.  The function reads `devices.yaml`, looks for an entry matching the current device's hostname.
4.  If a match is found, it returns the `lines_per_page` value from that entry.
5.  If no match is found, it returns a hard-coded default value (e.g., `10`) to ensure functionality.

**`devices.yaml` Configuration Example:**

```yaml
# devices.yaml

# Defines UI properties for different hardware profiles.
# The key for each entry should match the device's hostname.

# Configuration for a small Raspberry Pi with a 3.5" screen
raspberrypi-device:
  display_type: "3.5inch_hat"
  lines_per_page: 5  # Show fewer lines to keep text readable
  font_size: "small"

# Configuration for a standard desktop development machine
dev-machine-ubuntu:
  display_type: "1080p_monitor"
  lines_per_page: 20 # Can fit many more lines
  font_size: "normal"

# A fallback or generic profile
default:
  display_type: "unknown"
  lines_per_page: 10
  font_size: "normal"
```

**Code Usage Snippet:**

```python
# In a hypothetical ui_renderer.py file

from . import ui_utils

def draw_conversation_history(messages):
    lines_to_show = ui_utils.get_lines_per_page()
    
    # Get the last 'n' messages to display on the current page
    visible_messages = messages[-lines_to_show:]
    
    for message in visible_messages:
        # ... logic to draw the message on the screen
        pass
```

**Workaround / Fix:**
If the UI appears broken or text overflows on a new device, the immediate fix is to add a new entry to `devices.yaml` with the device's hostname as the key and adjust `lines_per_page` accordingly. This avoids any need for code changes.

## Section 6: WebSocket Connection Lifecycle and Defensive Programming

The lifecycle of a WebSocket connection is fragile. Clients can disconnect at any moment due to network issues, app closures, or other unforeseen circumstances. A robust backend must anticipate these failures and handle them gracefully to prevent server-side errors and ensure service stability. This section outlines defensive programming patterns and specific fixes for common lifecycle challenges.

### 1. Fixing `OSError: Address already in use` on Startup

A common and frustrating error during development and deployment is `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use`. This occurs when the server is restarted quickly. The operating system keeps the socket in a `TIME_WAIT` state for a short period after the process terminates to ensure any lingering packets are handled. Attempting to bind to the same address and port during this window results in the error.

**Solution: Set the `SO_REUSEADDR` Socket Option**

The solution is to instruct the OS to allow immediate reuse of the socket address. This is achieved by setting the `SO_REUSEADDR` flag on the listening socket *before* it is bound.

Most high-level WebSocket libraries provide a simple way to enable this. For the Python `websockets` library, this is handled via the `reuse_port` argument.

**Configuration Example (Python `websockets` library)**

The `reuse_port=True` parameter directly addresses this issue by setting the necessary underlying socket options.

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

async def handler(websocket, path):
    # ... connection logic ...
    await websocket.send("Connection established.")

# When starting the server, set reuse_port=True
start_server = websockets.serve(
    handler,
    "0.0.0.0",
    8765,
    reuse_port=True  # This is the key fix
)

print("WebSocket server starting on ws://0.0.0.0:8765")
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
```

By enabling `reuse_port`, you can stop and restart the server immediately without encountering the "Address already in use" error, significantly improving the development and deployment workflow.

### 2. Multi-Layer Fallback for Device ID Parsing

Reliably identifying a connecting device is crucial for state management, authentication, and targeted messaging. However, different clients (e.g., mobile apps, web browsers, test scripts) may send the device ID in various, sometimes non-standard, ways. A defensive parsing strategy is required to handle this inconsistency.

We implement a multi-layer fallback strategy that attempts to find the device ID in the following order of preference:

1.  **Handshake URI Parser**: From the request path (e.g., `/ws/device-123`).
2.  **Standard HTTP Header**: `device-id`
3.  **Non-Standard HTTP Headers**: `x-device-id`, `x-device_id`
4.  **Auto-Generation**: As a last resort, generate a new UUID for the session.

**Code Snippet: Device ID Parsing Logic**

This function can be called immediately after a connection is established to identify the client.

```python
import uuid
import logging
from websockets.server import WebSocketServerProtocol
from websockets.http import Headers

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def get_device_id(websocket: WebSocketServerProtocol) -> str:
    """
    Parses the device ID from the connection using a multi-layer fallback strategy.
    
    Args:
        websocket: The active WebSocket server protocol instance.
        
    Returns:
        The identified or generated device ID as a string.
    """
    path = websocket.path
    headers = websocket.request_headers

    # 1. Attempt to parse from the request path (e.g., /ws/device-id-123)
    path_parts = path.strip("/").split("/")
    if len(path_parts) > 1 and path_parts[0] == 'ws':
        device_id = path_parts[1]
        logging.info(f"Identified device '{device_id}' from request path.")
        return device_id

    # 2. Attempt to parse from standard 'device-id' header
    if "device-id" in headers:
        device_id = headers["device-id"]
        logging.info(f"Identified device '{device_id}' from 'device-id' header.")
        return device_id

    # 3. Fallback to non-standard headers
    for header in ["x-device-id", "x-device_id"]:
        if header in headers:
            device_id = headers[header]
            logging.info(f"Identified device '{device_id}' from non-standard '{header}' header.")
            return device_id

    # 4. Final fallback: generate a new UUID for this session
    generated_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    logging.warning(
        f"Could not find device ID in path or headers. "
        f"Generated temporary ID: {generated_id}"
    )
    return generated_id

# Example usage within a connection handler
async def main_handler(websocket, path):
    device_id = get_device_id(websocket)
    # ... rest of the connection logic using device_id ...
```

### 3. The WebSocket API Abstraction (Safe Send/Recv) Pattern

Any `await websocket.send()` or `await websocket.recv()` call can raise a `websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed` error if the client has disconnected. If unhandled, this exception will crash the server-side coroutine managing that specific connection.

**Problematic Code (Without Abstraction)**

```python
import asyncio
from websockets.exceptions import ConnectionClosed

async def unstable_handler(websocket, path):
    # This might work...
    await websocket.send("Welcome!")
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    
    # ...but if the client disconnects during the sleep, this line will CRASH the handler
    try:
        await websocket.send("Are you still there?") 
    except ConnectionClosed:
        print("Handler crashed because connection was closed.")
        # The coroutine terminates here.
    
    # This code is never reached if the connection was closed.
    print("Logic after second send.")
```

**Solution: A Safe Wrapper Function**

To make the application logic cleaner and more robust, we abstract the send/receive operations into "safe" wrapper functions that handle these exceptions internally.

**Code Snippet: `safe_send` Abstraction**

This function wraps the `send` call in a `try...except` block, logs the error, and returns a boolean indicating success or failure. The main application logic can then proceed without crashing.

```python
import logging
from websockets.server import WebSocketServerProtocol
from websockets.exceptions import ConnectionClosed, ConnectionClosedOK, ConnectionClosedError

async def safe_send(websocket: WebSocketServerProtocol, message: str) -> bool:
    """
    Safely sends a message to a WebSocket client, handling connection closures.

    Args:
        websocket: The WebSocket connection object.
        message: The string message to send.

    Returns:
        True if the message was sent successfully, False otherwise.
    """
    if not websocket.open:
        logging.warning(f"Attempted to send message on a closed WebSocket.")
        return False
    try:
        await websocket.send(message)
        return True
    except (ConnectionClosed, ConnectionClosedOK, ConnectionClosedError) as e:
        # Log the specific reason for the closure for debugging purposes.
        logging.info(f"Failed to send message: Connection closed. Reason: {e}")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch other potential exceptions during send.
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred during send: {e}")
        return False

# Example usage of the safe abstraction
async def robust_handler(websocket, path):
    device_id = get_device_id(websocket)
    
    # Now the main logic is clean and doesn't need try/except blocks for sending.
    if not await safe_send(websocket, f"Welcome, {device_id}!"):
        # If send fails, we know the connection is dead and can exit cleanly.
        logging.warning(f"[{device_id}] Initial handshake failed. Closing handler.")
        return

    await asyncio.sleep(10)

    # The logic continues without fear of crashing.
    success = await safe_send(websocket, "This is a periodic update.")
    if success:
        logging.info(f"[{device_id}] Successfully sent periodic update.")
    else:
        logging.warning(f"[{device_id}] Could not send update. Connection likely lost.")
```

This pattern is essential for long-lived connections. It centralizes connection error handling, prevents coroutine crashes, and makes the primary business logic significantly cleaner and easier to maintain. A similar `safe_recv` wrapper should also be implemented for reading incoming messages.

## Section 7: UI/UX Flow and Specific Rendering Payloads

The user experience is tightly coupled with a series of specific render payloads sent from the backend. Understanding this flow is critical for debugging UI behavior and making targeted improvements. This section details the key patterns, payloads, and fixes that define the application's interactive flow.

### Eliminating UI Flicker by Removing Intermediate Renders (`dlg-active`)

A noticeable UI flicker was present when the device transitioned from listening to the user's speech to displaying the assistant's response.

**Problem:** The UI would briefly flash or redraw in an intermediate state before showing the final content.

**Root Cause:** The backend was emitting a transitional render payload immediately after processing the user's query but before the full response was ready. This payload, identified by `{"id": "dlg-active"}`, was intended to signify that the dialog system was "active" or "thinking." However, it triggered an unnecessary and jarring UI rerender.

**Solution: Suppressing the Intermediate Payload**

The fix was to remove the emission of the `dlg-active` payload from the backend logic. The UI now maintains the "listening" state until the first payload containing actual response content is received, resulting in a smooth, direct transition to the assistant's answer.

**Payload Sequence Comparison:**

*   **Before Fix (Flicker Occurs):**
    1.  User speaks: `{"event": "user_speech_detected"}`
    2.  Backend acknowledges: `{"id": "dlg-active"}` -> **Causes UI Flicker**
    3.  Backend sends final response: `{"id": "final_response", "content": "..."}`

*   **After Fix (Smooth Transition):**
    1.  User speaks: `{"event": "user_speech_detected"}`
    2.  (No intermediate payload is sent)
    3.  Backend sends final response: `{"id": "final_response", "content": "..."}`

### Backend-Driven UI Guidance (`footer.hint`)

The application guides the user on what to do next via contextual hints displayed in the UI footer. This text is not hardcoded in the client; it is dynamically supplied by the backend based on the application's current state.

**Pattern:** When the application is in a state that requires a specific voice command to proceed, the backend sends a render payload containing a `footer.hint` object with the instructional text.

**Example: "Start Chat" Prompt**

When the user needs to initiate a conversation, the backend sends the following payload to prompt them with the exact required phrase.

**Payload Snippet:**
```json
{
  "render": {
    "footer": {
      "hint": "说\"开始聊天\"继续"
    }
  }
}
```

This JSON directly instructs the UI to display the text "说\"开始聊天\"继续" (translation: "Say 'start chat' to continue"), making the voice command interaction clear and unambiguous for the user.

### Paginated Rendering for Long Assistant Responses

To handle long text responses from the assistant without overwhelming the screen or creating long, unmanageable text blocks, a "paginated rendering" pattern is used. This presents the response in a continuously updating, fixed-size window.

**Mechanism: 10-Line Circular Buffer**

The frontend maintains a circular display buffer with a strict limit of **10 lines**. As the assistant's response is streamed from the backend line-by-line, the following logic is applied:
1.  Lines 1 through 10 are added to the display area normally.
2.  When the 11th line is received, the 1st (oldest) line is removed from the top of the display.
3.  The 11th line is then added to the bottom.
4.  This process continues, creating a "ticker-tape" effect where the user always sees the 10 most recent lines of the response.

**Error Scenario:** If the backend sends a single text block with more than 10 newline characters (`\n`), the client-side logic is responsible for splitting it and applying the circular buffer logic to prevent UI overflow.

### Sanitizing Unwanted Characters in Conversation History (`•`)

An issue was identified where conversation history items were incorrectly prefixed with a bullet point character (`•`), which was a formatting artifact from an upstream service.

**Problem:** User utterances in the conversation history list were displayed as `• Tell me a joke` instead of `Tell me a joke`.

**Root Cause:** The backend service that provides the history data sometimes includes markdown-style list formatting characters that are not intended for the final UI render.

**Fix: Client-Side String Sanitization**

A sanitization function was added to the client-side rendering logic for history items. This function explicitly checks for and removes the leading `• ` (bullet point followed by a space) before the string is displayed.

**Example Implementation (JavaScript):**
```javascript
/**
 * Cleans unwanted formatting artifacts from conversation history text.
 * @param {string} historyText - The raw text from the backend.
 * @returns {string} - The sanitized text for display.
 */
function sanitizeHistoryItem(historyText) {
  if (typeof historyText === 'string' && historyText.startsWith('• ')) {
    // Return the substring starting after the '• '
    return historyText.substring(2);
  }
  // Return the original text if the prefix is not found
  return historyText;
}

// Example Usage
const rawHistoryText = "• What is the weather today?";
const display_text = sanitizeHistoryItem(rawHistoryText);
// console.log(display_text) -> "What is the weather today?"

const normalText = "Hello world.";
const unchanged_text = sanitizeHistoryItem(normalText);
// console.log(unchanged_text) -> "Hello world."
```

## Section 8: Observability, Debugging, and Known Issues

### 8.1. Logging and Monitoring

Effective logging is crucial for debugging the application, especially for distributed components and real-time data flows like the audio pipeline. This section details key logging patterns, what they mean, and how to use them.

#### 8.1.1. Key Log Tags

Our structured logging uses tags to identify the source and context of a log message. When troubleshooting, filtering by these tags is the most efficient way to isolate an issue.

-   `[WEBSOCKET]`: All logs related to the WebSocket connection, including connection, disconnection, and message handling events.
-   `[AUDIO_PIPELINE]`: Logs from the audio processing and streaming pipeline. Essential for debugging audio quality, latency, and transcription issues.
-   `[STATE_MACHINE]`: Logs concerning the application's state transitions (e.g., from `idle` to `listening` to `speaking`).
-   `[CONFIG]`: Logs related to loading, parsing, and validating application configuration.
-   `[DROP_BY_MODE]`: A specific warning log that indicates a message was intentionally dropped due to system mode configuration. See below for details.

#### 8.1.2. Message Forwarding and `[DROP_BY_MODE]`

The system is designed to operate in different modes (e.g., `production`, `debug`, `e2e_test`). To optimize performance and reduce noise, a message forwarding whitelist determines which event types are processed in each mode.

If a component emits a message that is not on the whitelist for the current operating mode, the message is dropped, and a `[DROP_BY_MODE]` log is generated. This is **expected behavior**, not an error.

**Example Scenario:**
The `system_thought_process` message, which contains verbose internal reasoning, is only enabled in `debug` mode. If the system is running in `production` mode, it will drop this message.

**Sample Log Message:**
```
[WARN] 2023-10-27 11:34:12 [DROP_BY_MODE] Dropped message 'system_thought_process' because it is not whitelisted for 'production' mode.
```

**Solution:**
If you need to receive a specific message type, ensure you are running the system in a mode where that message is whitelisted. Check the `message_whitelist.yaml` configuration file to see the mapping of modes to allowed messages.

#### 8.1.3. Audio Pipeline Performance Logs

To diagnose chopy audio, high latency, or other real-time performance issues, you can enable `DEBUG` level logging for the audio pipeline. This will print detailed performance metrics for each audio chunk being processed.

**How to Enable:**
Set the logger level for `your_app.audio_pipeline` to `DEBUG` in your logging configuration.

**Sample Performance Log:**
```
[DEBUG] 2023-10-27 11:35:45 [AUDIO_PIPELINE] Processed audio chunk: frames=1600 bytes_total=3200 processing_time_ms=15
```

**Metrics Explained:**

*   `frames=N`: The number of audio frames in the processed chunk. A single frame is a 16-bit PCM sample, which is 2 bytes. This metric is fundamental for understanding the packet size being handled by the speech-to-text engine.
*   `bytes_total=...`: The total size of the audio chunk in bytes. This value should always be `frames * 2`. A discrepancy may indicate an encoding or data corruption issue upstream.
*   `processing_time_ms=...`: The time in milliseconds it took the pipeline to process this chunk. If this value consistently approaches or exceeds the audio chunk duration (e.g., >100ms for a 100ms audio chunk), the system cannot keep up with the real-time stream, leading to buffer overruns and perceived latency.

### 8.2. Common UI and Frontend Issues

#### 8.2.1. `listen.start` Event Debouncing

To ensure a stable user experience and prevent the backend from being flooded with rapid, conflicting requests, the `listen.start` event triggered by the UI's primary "Listen" button is debounced.

*   **Behavior:** When the user clicks the "Listen" button, a `listen.start` event is sent to the backend.
*   **Debounce Interval:** After one `listen.start` event is sent, the UI will ignore any subsequent clicks on the button for **300ms**.
*   **Why?** This prevents accidental double-clicks from attempting to open a second, conflicting audio stream while the first one is still being established. It ensures the application's state machine can transition cleanly from `idle` to `listening`.
*   **Implication:** When manually testing, rapid-fire clicks on the listen button will not result in a stream of `listen.start` events. Only the first click in a 300ms window will be registered. This is the intended and correct behavior.

### 8.3. Development and Tooling Known Issues

#### 8.3.1. Pylint False Positive with Pydantic Validators

A common annoyance during development is a false positive from the Pylint linter when using Pydantic's validator pattern.

**The Problem:**
Pydantic validators use a standard function signature where the value being validated is passed as an argument, conventionally named `v`. Pylint incorrectly flags this variable as unused.

**Example Code Triggering the False Positive:**
```python
#
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class Settings(BaseModel):
    api_key: str

    @validator("api_key")
    def api_key_must_be_valid(cls, v):  # Pylint: "W0612: Unused variable 'v'"
        if not v.startswith("sk-"):
            raise ValueError("API key must start with 'sk-'")
        return v
```

**The Error Message:**
```
your_file.py:8:32: W0612: Unused variable 'v' (unused-variable)
```

**Solution:**
This is a known issue. The argument `v` is used by the Pydantic decorator's machinery. The correct fix is to instruct Pylint to ignore unused variable warnings for commonly used placeholder names like `v` and `cls`.

Add the `dummy-variables-rgx` setting to your `.pylintrc` file in the `[MESSAGES CONTROL]` section. This whitelists specific variable names from the `unused-variable` check.

**`.pylintrc` Configuration Change:**

```ini
[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Add or modify this line. It uses a regex to match common dummy variable names.
# This prevents Pylint from flagging 'v' in Pydantic validators or 'cls'
# in classmethods.
dummy-variables-rgx=^(_|v|cls|args|kwargs)$
```

This resolves the false positive without globally disabling the useful `unused-variable` warning for other, genuinely unused variables.
