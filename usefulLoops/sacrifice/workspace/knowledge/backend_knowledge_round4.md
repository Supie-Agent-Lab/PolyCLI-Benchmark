## Section 1: System Startup, Shutdown, and Process Integrity

This section details the critical patterns and fixes required to ensure the backend service is robust during its lifecycle events: startup, shutdown, and restart. Issues addressed include race conditions during initialization, process management for graceful restarts, and cross-version Python compatibility.

### 1. The `__init__` `NameError` Fix: The 'Parent Initializer First' Pattern

A common but critical bug can occur in object-oriented Python applications when a child class attempts to use an attribute initialized by its parent *before* the parent's `__init__` method has been called. This results in a `NameError`.

**The Problem:** The child class's `__init__` performs its own setup first, assuming parent attributes are already available.

**Example Error Message:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "my_service.py", line 25, in <module>
    service = APIService()
  File "my_service.py", line 18, in __init__
    self.logger.info(f"Initializing APIService with custom setting: {self.custom_setting}")
AttributeError: 'APIService' object has no attribute 'logger'
```
*(Note: Depending on the exact access pattern, this could also manifest as a `NameError` if the attribute was being assigned to a local variable.)*

**The Pattern:** Always call `super().__init__(...)` as the very first statement in a child class's `__init__` method. This ensures that the parent class is fully initialized before the child class begins its own specific setup, guaranteeing all parent-defined attributes are present.

**Code Example (Before Fix):**
```python
# base_service.py
import logging

class BaseService:
    def __init__(self, service_name="Base"):
        # The parent initializer sets up critical components like the logger.
        self.service_name = service_name
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.service_name)
        # ... other base initializations

# api_service.py
from base_service import BaseService

class APIService(BaseService):
    def __init__(self):
        # INCORRECT: Child logic runs before parent is initialized.
        self.custom_setting = "production_mode"
        self.logger.info(f"Initializing APIService...") # CRASHES HERE: self.logger does not exist yet.

        # The parent __init__ is called too late.
        super().__init__(service_name="API")
```

**Code Example (After Fix - 'Parent Initializer First'):**
```python
# base_service.py (remains the same)
import logging

class BaseService:
    def __init__(self, service_name="Base"):
        self.service_name = service_name
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.service_name)
        # ... other base initializations

# api_service.py
from base_service import BaseService

class APIService(BaseService):
    def __init__(self):
        # CORRECT: Call the parent initializer FIRST.
        super().__init__(service_name="API")

        # Now, parent attributes like self.logger are guaranteed to exist.
        self.custom_setting = "production_mode"
        self.logger.info(f"Initializing APIService with custom setting: {self.custom_setting}")
```

### 2. The 'Detached Subprocess Invocation Pattern' for Graceful Restarts

To implement a reliable, in-place restart of the service (e.g., via an API endpoint), simply starting a new process is not sufficient. The new process must be completely detached from the parent (the currently running service) to prevent it from being killed when the parent exits and to avoid terminal control signal issues.

**The Problem:** A naive `subprocess.run()` or `os.exec()` can lead to the new process inheriting the parent's process group and terminal control. When the parent process, which is part of a shell's job control, exits, the OS may send signals like `SIGHUP` or `SIGTERM` to the entire process group, killing the newly started child. Furthermore, if the new process ever attempts to read from standard input, it can be suspended by a `SIGTTIN` signal.

**The Pattern:** Use `subprocess.Popen` with specific arguments to create a fully detached, new session leader process with its standard I/O streams redirected from `/dev/null`. This makes it a true daemon-like process, independent of its creator.

**Complete Code Snippet:**
```python
import sys
import os
import subprocess

def restart_service():
    """
    Triggers a graceful, detached restart of the current service.
    This function replaces the current process with a new instance.
    """
    print("Service restart triggered. Launching new process...")

    # Ensure all file descriptors are written before we fork.
    sys.stdout.flush()
    sys.stderr.flush()

    # The command to re-run the script is built from sys.executable and sys.argv.
    # This is more robust than hardcoding "python my_script.py".
    command = [sys.executable] + sys.argv

    # DEVNULL is used to detach the new process's standard streams.
    from subprocess import DEVNULL

    subprocess.Popen(
        command,
        # stdin=DEVNULL is critical. It prevents the new process from ever trying
        # to read from the original controlling tty, thus avoiding a SIGTTIN signal
        # which would suspend it.
        stdin=DEVNULL,

        # stdout and stderr can be redirected to DEVNULL to make the new process
        # fully detached, or pointed to log files.
        stdout=DEVNULL,
        stderr=DEVNULL,

        # start_new_session=True (on POSIX) is the key to detachment.
        # It runs the command in a new session, making it the session leader
        # and detaching it from the parent's controlling terminal and process group.
        # This prevents it from being killed when the parent process exits.
        # On Windows, this is equivalent to the DETACHED_PROCESS creation flag.
        start_new_session=True
    )

    # After launching the new process, the old one must exit cleanly.
    print("Old process exiting.")
    # A simple os._exit(0) can be used, but a more graceful shutdown
    # by signaling an application-level event is preferred.
    # For this example, we'll assume a clean exit is triggered after this function returns.
    # e.g., sys.exit(0)
```

**Understanding `SIGTTIN` and the Solution:**
*   **What is `SIGTTIN`?** On UNIX-like operating systems, the kernel sends the `SIGTTIN` signal to a process when it is in a *background process group* and attempts to *read* from its controlling terminal (`tty`). The default action for `SIGTTIN` is to **stop (suspend)** the process.
*   **Why does it happen here?** Our service is a background process. If we don't handle `stdin`, it remains connected to the terminal that launched the original script. If any part of the newly launched code (even a third-party library) ever tries to read from `stdin`, the OS will immediately suspend it with `SIGTTIN`. The process will be frozen, not crashed, making it difficult to debug.
*   **How the Patter Fixes It:**
    1.  `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`: This retargets the new process's standard input to the null device. It will never try to read from the controlling terminal because its `stdin` isn't connected to it. Any read attempts will immediately receive an End-Of-File (EOF) instead of blocking or triggering a signal.
    2.  `start_new_session=True`: This provides a more fundamental separation. The new process becomes the leader of a new session and is no longer a member of the old process's process group. This fully decouples it from the parent's terminal, preventing signals like `SIGTTIN`, `SIGTTOU`, and `SIGHUP` from affecting it.

### 3. Python Version Compatibility for `ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown()`

The `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` is frequently used for managing background tasks. Its `shutdown()` method evolved in Python 3.9 to include a `cancel_futures` argument, providing a more robust way to terminate. Relying on this argument without accounting for older Python versions will cause a crash.

**The Problem:** Code written on Python 3.9+ might use `executor.shutdown(cancel_futures=True)`. When this code is run on Python 3.8 or earlier, it fails because the `shutdown` method does not recognize this keyword argument.

**Example Error Message (on Python <= 3.8):**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "my_app.py", line 42, in shutdown_workers
    self.executor.shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=True)
TypeError: shutdown() got an unexpected keyword argument 'cancel_futures'
```

**The Fix:** Use a `try...except TypeError` block. This is the most Pythonic and robust way to handle feature flags that differ between versions. It avoids brittle version checking (e.g., `if sys.version_info >= (3, 9)`), as it directly tests for the feature's availability.

**Code Example (Robust Shutdown Logic):**
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class WorkerManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

    def do_work(self):
        # Submit tasks to the executor
        # self.executor.submit(...)
        pass

    def shutdown(self):
        """
        Shuts down the ThreadPoolExecutor gracefully, maintaining compatibility
        with Python versions before and after 3.9.
        """
        print("Shutting down worker threads...")
        try:
            # The modern, preferred way: attempt to cancel pending futures on shutdown.
            # This is available in Python 3.9+.
            self.executor.shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=True)
            print("Shutdown complete (with future cancellation).")
        except TypeError:
            # Fallback for older Python versions (<= 3.8) that don't have
            # the 'cancel_futures' argument.
            print("Older Python version detected. Shutting down without canceling futures.")
            self.executor.shutdown(wait=True)
            print("Shutdown complete (without future cancellation).")

# Usage
manager = WorkerManager()
# ... do work ...
manager.shutdown()
```
This pattern ensures that the application leverages the best available shutdown mechanism on newer Python versions while remaining fully functional and not crashing on older, supported versions.

## Section 2: WebSocket Communication Protocol and Connection Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a WebSocket connection is the core of our real-time communication system. Understanding each phase, from server readiness to graceful termination, is critical for stability and debugging.

### 2.1 Pre-Connection: Server Startup `Address already in use` Fix

A common and disruptive issue when rapidly restarting the server for development or deployment is the `OSError`.

**Error Message:**
```
OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use
```

This occurs because the operating system keeps the socket in a `TIME_WAIT` state for a short period after the process terminates, preventing a new process from immediately binding to the same address and port.

**Solution: Enable `SO_REUSEADDR` Socket Option**

The solution is to instruct the underlying socket to allow address reuse. The `websockets` library allows passing socket options directly to the `websockets.serve()` function.

**Implementation:**

When starting the WebSocket server, set the `SO_REUSEADDR` option.

```python
import asyncio
import socket
import websockets

async def handler(websocket, path):
    # ... your websocket handler logic ...
    pass

# Correct way to start the server to prevent 'Address already in use'
start_server = websockets.serve(
    handler,
    "0.0.0.0",
    8765,
    # This tuple is the key to the solution
    sock=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM),
    extra_headers={"Server": "MyAsyncServer"},
    create_protocol=lambda sock: websockets.WebSocketServerProtocol(
        sock=sock,
        extra_headers={"Server": "MyAsyncServer"},
        # Explicitly set the socket option
        socket_options=[(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)]
    )
)

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
```
**Note:** The `websockets` library has evolved. For newer versions, passing `sock` and `create_protocol` might differ. The fundamental principle of setting `SO_REUSEADDR` on the listening socket remains the same. This fix makes the development and redeployment cycle significantly smoother.

### 2.2 Connection Initiation: The `hello` Handshake

Upon establishing a TCP connection and completing the WebSocket upgrade handshake, the client **must** send a specific JSON message as its first data frame. This `hello` message authenticates and configures the audio stream for the session. The server will not process any audio data until this message is received and validated.

The message must be a JSON string with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "uid": "some-unique-user-or-session-id",
  "audio_params": {
    "sample_rate": 16000,
    "channels": 1,
    "sample_width": 2
  }
}
```

#### `audio_params` Dictionary Structure

The `audio_params` object is mandatory and must contain all the specified keys.

| Key | Type | Valid Values | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sample_rate` | Integer | `8000`, `16000`, `22050`, `44100`, `48000` | The sampling rate of the audio stream in Hz. `16000` is standard for voice. |
| `channels` | Integer | `1` (Mono), `2` (Stereo) | Number of audio channels. Our system currently processes only the first channel if stereo is sent. `1` is recommended. |
| `sample_width`| Integer | `2` (16-bit) | The number of bytes per audio sample. Must be `2` for 16-bit signed integer PCM audio. |

If the initial message is not a valid JSON, is missing keys, or has invalid values in `audio_params`, the server will immediately close the connection with close code `1002` (Protocol Error).

### 2.3 Handling Duplicate Connections: The 'Dual-Channel Transition' Pattern

A user might connect from a new tab or device, or their connection might flap, resulting in a new connection attempt while the server still considers the old one active. Simply dropping the old connection can lead to lost messages and a poor user experience.

The **Dual-Channel Transition** pattern ensures a smooth handover.

1.  A new WebSocket connection is established and sends a `hello` message with a `uid` that is already associated with an active connection.
2.  The server accepts the new connection and immediately designates it as the *primary channel* for all future outbound messages to that `uid`.
3.  The server marks the *old* connection for closure but does not close it immediately. Instead, it schedules a deferred close.
4.  This brief delay allows any final in-flight messages from the server to the old client to be sent and acknowledged, preventing race conditions.

**Implementation: Deferred Close with `asyncio.create_task`**

Using `asyncio.create_task` is crucial because it schedules the `deferred_close` coroutine to run concurrently without blocking the main task of handling the new connection.

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from websockets.exceptions import ConnectionClosed

# Assume 'connections' is a dictionary mapping uid -> websocket object
connections = {}

async def deferred_close(websocket, uid):
    """
    Waits for a short period before closing the old websocket connection.
    This allows any final messages to be sent.
    """
    logging.info(f"Scheduling deferred close for old connection of UID: {uid}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2.0)  # A 2-second grace period
    try:
        if websocket.open:
            await websocket.close(code=1001, reason="New connection established")
            logging.info(f"Old connection for UID {uid} gracefully closed.")
    except ConnectionClosed:
        logging.warning(f"Old connection for UID {uid} was already closed.")

async def register_new_connection(websocket, uid):
    """
    Handles a new connection, including the dual-channel transition.
    """
    if uid in connections:
        old_websocket = connections[uid]
        logging.warning(f"Duplicate connection for UID: {uid}. Starting dual-channel transition.")
        # Schedule the old connection to be closed without blocking
        asyncio.create_task(deferred_close(old_websocket, uid))

    # The new connection immediately becomes the primary one
    connections[uid] = websocket
    logging.info(f"Registered new primary connection for UID: {uid}")

# In your main handler, after receiving the `hello` message:
# await register_new_connection(websocket, received_data['uid'])
```

### 2.4 Robust Message Sending: The 'WebSocket API Abstraction' Pattern

Directly calling `await websocket.send()` is risky. If the client has disconnected (e.g., closed the browser tab), this call will raise a `websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed` exception, which can crash the sending task if unhandled.

The **WebSocket API Abstraction** pattern involves wrapping the send call in a utility function that gracefully handles these exceptions.

**Implementation: The `send_message_safely` Wrapper**

This approach centralizes error handling and adds robustness to all parts of the application that send messages.

```python
import logging
import json
from websockets.exceptions import ConnectionClosed, ConnectionClosedOK

async def send_message_safely(websocket, message_dict, uid):
    """
    Serializes a dictionary to JSON and sends it to the websocket,
    handling connection closures gracefully.

    Args:
        websocket: The websocket object to send to.
        message_dict: A Python dictionary to be sent as a JSON string.
        uid: The user ID, for logging purposes.

    Returns:
        bool: True if send was successful, False otherwise.
    """
    if not websocket or not websocket.open:
        logging.warning(f"Attempted to send to a non-existent or closed websocket for UID: {uid}")
        return False

    try:
        payload = json.dumps(message_dict)
        await websocket.send(payload)
        return True
    except (ConnectionClosed, ConnectionClosedOK):
        logging.info(f"Failed to send message to UID {uid}: Connection was closed by the client.")
        # Here you might trigger cleanup logic, like removing the user from the active 'connections' dict
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred while sending message to UID {uid}: {e}")
        return False

# --- Example Usage ---
# Instead of this:
# await websocket.send(json.dumps({"type": "update", "content": "hello"}))

# Do this:
# success = await send_message_safely(
#     websocket,
#     {"type": "update", "content": "hello"},
#     user_id
# )
# if not success:
#     # Handle the failed send if necessary
#     pass
```
By consistently using `send_message_safely`, the system becomes resilient to abrupt client disconnections, preventing server-side errors and ensuring that one client's disconnection doesn't affect tasks handling other clients.

## Section 3: Backend State Management and User Interaction Logic

The backend orchestrates the entire user conversation through a carefully managed state machine. This machine dictates what the user sees and how the system responds to events, ensuring a smooth and predictable user experience. The primary state machine governs the conversation dialog flow.

### 3.1 The Dialog State Machine

The core of the user interaction is the `dialog` mode state machine. It transitions through several states in response to user actions and LLM activity. The backend uses a `state` variable, typically managed in a user session object, to track the current position in the flow. Each state transition triggers a `ui.render` event, pushing a new UI configuration to the frontend.

The primary flow is: `connected.idle` → `dialog.preparing` → `dialog.active`.

---

#### **State: `connected.idle`**

*   **Description**: This is the default state when a user is connected but no active conversation with the LLM is in progress. The UI is waiting for user input.
*   **Entry Trigger**:
    1.  Initial connection of the user to the backend server.
    2.  Successful completion of an LLM response stream (`dialog.active` state concludes).
    3.  An error occurs, and the system is reset.
*   **UI Payload (`ui.render`)**: The payload signals to the frontend that the input prompt is enabled and the system is ready.
    ```json
    {
      "mode": "dialog",
      "state": "connected.idle",
      "prompt_enabled": true,
      "content": "<div>Welcome! How can I help you today?</div>",
      "bHasError": false
    }
    ```
*   **Exit Trigger**: The user types a message in the chat input and presses Enter or clicks the Send button. This action sends a `user_prompt` event to the backend.

---

#### **State: `dialog.preparing`**

*   **Description**: A transient state indicating the backend has received the user's prompt and is preparing the request to the LLM. This includes assembling the conversation history, system-level instructions, and the new user prompt.
*   **Entry Trigger**: Backend receives a `user_prompt` event from the frontend.
*   **UI Payload (`ui.render`)**: The payload disables the input prompt to prevent concurrent requests and shows a "thinking" indicator. The user's new prompt is echoed back immediately for a responsive feel.
    ```json
    {
      "mode": "dialog",
      "state": "dialog.preparing",
      "prompt_enabled": false,
      "content": "<div>User: How does the state machine work?</div><div>Assistant: Thinking...</div>",
      "bHasError": false
    }
    ```
*   **Exit Trigger**: The backend successfully establishes a streaming connection with the LLM API and receives the first token of the response.

---

#### **State: `dialog.active`**

*   **Description**: The system is actively receiving a streamed response from the LLM. The UI is locked, and the incoming tokens are progressively rendered to the user.
*   **Entry Trigger**: The first token from the LLM stream is received by the backend.
*   **UI Payload (`ui.render`)**: The payload for this state is sent repeatedly for each batch of new tokens. It continuously overwrites the "thinking" message with the accumulating response. The `state` key informs the UI that it should expect more updates.
    ```json
    // Payload after first token batch
    {
      "mode": "dialog",
      "state": "dialog.active",
      "prompt_enabled": false,
      "content": "<div>User: How does the state machine work?</div><div>Assistant: The state machine begins with the...</div>",
      "bHasError": false
    }
    ```
*   **Exit Trigger**: The LLM signals the end of its response stream. The backend then transitions the state machine back to `connected.idle`, re-enabling the prompt for the next turn.

---

### 3.2 The 'Jarring Flicker' Fix: Optimizing UI Renders

A significant UX issue was identified where the UI would "flicker" between the user submitting a prompt and the assistant's response appearing.

*   **The Problem**: The initial implementation involved two distinct `ui.render` calls in quick succession:
    1.  **User Submits Prompt**: Backend receives the prompt.
    2.  **Immediate Render 1**: `ui.render(state='dialog.preparing', content='Thinking...')`. This updated the UI to show the thinking indicator.
    3.  **LLM Call**: The backend calls the LLM, which might take 200-500ms to return the first token.
    4.  **Immediate Render 2**: Upon receiving the first token, `ui.render(state='dialog.active', content='The...')`.

    This sequence caused the "Thinking..." message to appear for a fraction of a second before being replaced by the actual response, resulting in a jarring flicker.

*   **The Solution**: The intermediate render call was eliminated. The backend now waits for the first token from the LLM before sending any UI update.

    **Revised Flow:**
    1.  **User Submits Prompt**: Backend receives the prompt and immediately disables the input UI on the client-side (or relies on the subsequent render to do so).
    2.  **LLM Call**: The backend calls the LLM. During this ~500ms wait, the UI remains unchanged.
    3.  **Single Render**: Upon receiving the first token, the backend sends its first `ui.render` call for this interaction: `ui.render(state='dialog.active', content='The...')`.

    This ensures a single, smooth content update from the user's prompt to the assistant's final response, creating a much more polished feel.

---

### 3.3 Paginated Rendering of Long LLM Responses

To handle long, verbose responses from the LLM without overwhelming the UI or the connection, we implement a pattern of paginated or batched rendering.

#### **Circular Buffer for Conversation History**

To prevent the context sent to the LLM from growing infinitely, we maintain the conversation history in a list and use a "circular buffer" pattern by slicing the list. We only keep the last `N` messages to send as context.

*   **Pattern**: `list[-N:]`
*   **Example**: If we want to keep a history of the last 10 messages (5 user, 5 assistant):
    ```python
    MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES = 10
    # conversation_history is a list of {"role": "...", "content": "..."} dicts
    
    def get_latest_context(conversation_history):
      # Slicing with a negative index gets the last N items
      return conversation_history[-MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES:]
    
    # When preparing the LLM call:
    context_to_send = get_latest_context(session.history)
    ```

#### **Token Batching Logic**

Instead of sending a `ui.render` call for every single token received from the LLM stream (which could be hundreds per second), we batch them. This dramatically reduces the number of WebSocket messages and client-side re-renders.

*   **Logic**:
    1.  Initialize an empty string or list to serve as a token buffer (`token_batch`).
    2.  As tokens arrive from the LLM stream, append them to the buffer.
    3.  Once the buffer reaches a predefined size (e.g., 50 characters) or a natural break (like a newline character), join the tokens and send them in a single `ui.render` payload.
    4.  Clear the buffer and repeat until the stream ends.
    5.  Always send any remaining tokens in the buffer when the stream is complete.

*   **Code Snippet (Conceptual)**:
    ```python
    def stream_and_batch_response(llm_stream, full_response_text):
        BATCH_SIZE = 50
        token_batch = []
        for token in llm_stream:
            token_batch.append(token)
            full_response_text += token
            # Send an update if the batch is full or we hit a newline
            if len("".join(token_batch)) >= BATCH_SIZE or "\n" in token:
                # This function sends the payload over the websocket
                send_ui_update(content=full_response_text, state='dialog.active')
                token_batch = [] # Reset the batch
        
        # Send any remaining tokens after the loop
        if token_batch:
            send_ui_update(content=full_response_text, state='dialog.active')
    ```

---

### 3.4 Error Handling: Malformed JSON from LLM Function Calls

A common failure point occurs when the LLM is asked to generate JSON for a function call and produces a malformed or improperly formatted string.

*   **Example Error Message from LLM**:
    ```
    "Of course, here is the JSON you requested: { \"tool_name\": \"get_weather\", \"parameters\": { \"city\": \"San Francisco\" } }. I hope this helps!"
    ```
    Standard `json.loads()` would fail on this string because of the surrounding text.

*   **Solution: `extract_json_from_string` Utility**: We use a resilient utility function that employs regular expressions to find and extract the first valid-looking JSON object or array from a larger string.

    ```python
    import re
    import json
    
    def extract_json_from_string(text: str) -> str | None:
        """
        Finds and extracts the first JSON object from a string.
        It looks for the content between the first '{' and the last '}'.

        handle_json_error("No JSON object found in LLM response.")

    ```

*   **Communicating the Error to the UI**: When JSON parsing fails, the backend must inform the user gracefully. This is done by setting a `bHasError` flag in the `ui.render` payload and providing a user-friendly error message. The state is then reset to `connected.idle`.

    **Example Error Payload**:
    ```json
    {
      "mode": "dialog",
      "state": "connected.idle", // Reset state
      "prompt_enabled": true,      // Re-enable prompt
      "content": "<div>Previous conversation...</div>", // Keep history
      "bHasError": true,
      "error_message": "Sorry, I received an invalid response from the AI and could not complete your request. Please try rephrasing your question."
    }
    ```
    The frontend is designed to listen for the `bHasError: true` flag and display the `error_message` in a noticeable but non-disruptive way, such as a toast notification or an inline error message.

## Section 4: Firmware (C++) - E-Ink Display and Network Stability

The E-Ink display is controlled via the U8g2 library. Correctly implementing rendering and managing the network receive thread are critical for a stable and predictable device. This section details the specific patterns and functions that must be used to avoid common bugs like the "white-on-white" text issue and catastrophic stack overflow crashes.

### Core Rendering Functions: `drawUTF8()` vs. `print()`

The U8g2 library provides multiple functions for drawing text, but only one is suitable for our needs. Using the incorrect function can lead to rendering artifacts, incorrect character display, and alignment issues.

**Deprecated/Incorrect Method: `u8g2_->print()`**
This function, common in Arduino examples, is part of the standard `Print` interface. It should **not** be used for our display rendering.

*   **Problems:**
    *   Does not handle UTF-8 characters correctly, leading to garbled text for symbols like the degree sign (°), currency symbols, or other non-ASCII characters.
    *   Does not respect the drawing buffer's coordinate system in the same way as dedicated U8g2 functions, making precise alignment difficult.
    *   Lacks the fine-grained control needed for our UI.

**Mandatory/Correct Method: `u8g2_->drawUTF8()`**
This is the required function for all text rendering on the E-Ink display.

*   **Syntax:** `u8g2->drawUTF8(x, y, text);`
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Full UTF-8 Support:** Correctly renders all character sets provided by the selected font.
    *   **Precise Positioning:** The `(x, y)` coordinates refer to the bottom-left corner of the first character's bounding box, enabling pixel-perfect alignment.
    *   **Consistency:** It is the standard U8g2 way to draw strings, ensuring predictable behavior.

**Example Implementation:**

```cpp
// Correct way to display a price with a Euro symbol
void renderPrice(const char* price) {
  // Set font before drawing
  u8g2_->setFont(u8g2_font_helvB12_tf); 
  
  // Set the position for the text
  int x = 10;
  int y = 50; // Y-coordinate is the baseline of the text

  // Use drawUTF8 for correct rendering
  u8g2_->drawUTF8(x, y, price); // e.g., price = "€123.45"
}
```

---

### The Stateful Color Rendering Pattern

A prevalent and difficult-to-diagnose bug is the "white-on-white" issue, where text or shapes are rendered with the same color as the background, making them invisible. This occurs because the U8g2 library is **stateful**, and the ESP32's partial update mechanism for the E-Ink display can leave the drawing color in an unexpected state.

**The Problem:** The `u8g2_->setDrawColor(color)` function (or its replacement, `setForegroundColor`) sets the color for all subsequent drawing operations until it is changed again. If one part of the code sets the color to white (0) and does not reset it, the next component that tries to draw may inadvertently draw its content in white.

**The Solution:** You **must** explicitly set both the foreground and background color before every logical drawing block. This defensive pattern ensures that each UI component is fully self-contained and does not rely on or pollute the global rendering state.

*   `u8g2_->setForegroundColor(GxEPD_BLACK);` // Color for text/shapes
*   `u8g2_->setBackgroundColor(GxEPD_WHITE);` // Color for the background area of the text/shapes

**Problematic Code (Prone to "white-on-white" bug):**
```cpp
void renderUI() {
  // Assumes color is already black - a dangerous assumption!
  u8g2_->drawUTF8(10, 20, "Bitcoin");
  
  // Another component might have left the color as white
  // for an inverted section.
  // u8g2_->setDrawColor(0); // <-- Imagine this happened elsewhere
  
  // This will now draw white text on a white background, making it invisible.
  u8g2_->drawUTF8(10, 40, "$50,000"); 
}
```

**Correct Implementation (Stateful Color Pattern):**
This pattern guarantees that each part of the UI renders correctly, regardless of what was drawn before it.

```cpp
void renderHeader() {
  // Set context for this specific component
  u8g2_->setForegroundColor(GxEPD_WHITE);
  u8g2_->setBackgroundColor(GxEPD_BLACK);
  u8g2_->setFont(u8g2_font_helvB10_tf);
  
  // Invert colors for a header bar
  u8g2_->drawBox(0, 0, EPD_WIDTH, 24); 
  u8g2_->drawUTF8(5, 17, "CURRENT PRICE");
}

void renderPrice() {
  // Set context for THIS component, resetting any previous state
  u8g2_->setForegroundColor(GxEPD_BLACK);
  u8g2_->setBackgroundColor(GxEPD_WHITE);
  u8g2_->setFont(u8g2_font_helvB24_tf);

  u8g2_->drawUTF8(10, 60, "$50,000");
}

// In the main display loop:
void display() {
  u8g2_->firstPage();
  do {
    renderHeader(); // Draws correctly in inverted colors
    renderPrice();  // Draws correctly in standard colors
  } while (u8g2_->nextPage());
}
```

### UI Rendering Responsibility Model

To maintain a clean separation of concerns, the system uses a clear model for UI rendering responsibilities between the backend server and the C++ firmware client.

*   **Backend Responsibility (The "What"):**
    *   The backend dictates **what** data to show.
    *   It sends abstract, high-level commands, not drawing instructions.
    *   It defines the UI *mode* or *template* (e.g., `price_view`, `chart_view`, `system_info`).
    *   It provides the raw data to populate these templates (e.g., `{"value": "50123.45", "change": "-2.1"}`).

*   **Firmware/Client Responsibility (The "How"):**
    *   The firmware dictates **how** to render the data for a given mode.
    *   It contains all the pixel-specific layout logic.
    *   It defines the fonts, coordinates, icons, and lines for each UI template.
    *   It translates the abstract data from the backend into concrete `u8g2->draw...()` calls.

**Example Flow:**
1.  **Backend sends:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "display_update",
      "template": "price_simple",
      "data": {
        "price": "€50,123.45",
        "change_24h": "+1.5%"
      }
    }
    ```
2.  **Firmware Client receives this message and:**
    *   Selects its internal `renderPriceSimple()` function.
    *   Parses `data.price` and `data.change_24h`.
    *   Executes hardcoded drawing commands to place the price at `(x1, y1)` with `font_A` and the 24h change at `(x2, y2)` with `font_B`.

This model allows the UI's look-and-feel to be updated via firmware flashes without requiring any backend changes.

---

### Network Stability: The "Thin Receive Thread" Pattern

**The Problem:** The device experiences unpredictable crashes, often reporting a `Guru Meditation Error: Core 1 panic'd (Stack canary watchpoint triggered)`. This indicates a stack overflow. These crashes correlate with receiving complex or frequent WebSocket messages from the backend.

**Root Cause:** The `arduinoWebSockets` library processes incoming messages in a dedicated FreeRTOS task (the "receive thread"). This task has a limited, fixed stack size. Performing heavy operations like parsing large JSON strings with `ArduinoJson` directly within the WebSocket event callback consumes significant stack memory, leading to an overflow and a system crash.

**The Solution: "Thin Receive Thread" Pattern**
To prevent stack overflows, the WebSocket receive thread must be kept "thin" by offloading all heavy processing to the main `loop()` task, which has a much larger stack.

The pattern is as follows:
1.  The WebSocket receive event handler (`webSocketEvent`) does the **absolute minimum** amount of work.
2.  A single, simple message type (e.g., `hello`) can be parsed directly in the callback for immediate response (e.g., a `world` reply). This is safe because its structure is fixed and parsing is trivial.
3.  **All other messages** are treated as opaque strings and are immediately pushed into a thread-safe queue.
4.  The main `loop()` function continuously checks this queue. If a message is present, it dequeues it and performs the heavy JSON parsing and subsequent logic safely in its own large-stack context.

**Code Example:**
```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>

// Use a standard queue and a mutex for thread-safe access
std::queue<String> messageQueue;
std::mutex queueMutex;

// The WebSocket event handler - MUST BE "THIN"
void webSocketEvent(WStype_t type, uint8_t * payload, size_t length) {
  switch (type) {
    case WStype_DISCONNECTED:
      Serial.println("[WSc] Disconnected!");
      break;
    case WStype_CONNECTED:
      Serial.println("[WSc] Connected to url: ");
      break;
    case WStype_TEXT:
      // This is the CRITICAL part of the pattern
      if (strcmp((char *)payload, "hello") == 0) {
        // 1. Handle simple, known messages directly. This is safe.
        Serial.println("[WSc] Received 'hello', sending 'world'");
        webSocket.sendTXT("world");
      } else {
        // 2. For all other (complex) messages, queue them. DO NOT PARSE HERE.
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
        messageQueue.push(String((char*)payload));
      }
      break;
    // ... other cases
  }
}

// The main application loop
void loop() {
  webSocket.loop(); // Keep the WebSocket client running

  // 3. Process the queue in the main loop (large stack)
  String message;
  {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
    if (!messageQueue.empty()) {
      message = messageQueue.front();
      messageQueue.pop();
    }
  } // Mutex is released here

  if (message.length() > 0) {
    Serial.printf("Processing message from queue: %s\n", message.c_str());
    // 4. Perform heavy JSON parsing and application logic safely here
    // DynamicJsonDocument doc(2048);
    // deserializeJson(doc, message);
    // ... handle the parsed data ...
  }
}
```
By implementing this pattern, the risk of stack overflow in the network stack is virtually eliminated, leading to a dramatically more stable device.

## Section 5: Firmware (C++) - Real-Time Audio Pipeline Protocol

### 5.1 The `tts:start` -> Binary -> `tts:stop` Protocol

The interaction between the host application processor and the firmware for audio playback is governed by a strict, stateful protocol over the serial interface. Failure to adhere to this protocol is the primary source of audio playback issues. The protocol ensures that the firmware's I2S peripheral and DMA controller are configured correctly *before* any audio data is sent and are cleanly shut down afterward.

The sequence is always:
1.  **`tts:start` Control Message:** A JSON object that prepares the hardware for a new audio stream.
2.  **Raw Binary Audio Frames:** A continuous stream of binary data chunks.
3.  **`tts:stop` Control Message:** A JSON object that finalizes the stream and de-initializes the hardware.

#### 5.1.1 The `tts:start` Control Message

This message acts as a "header" for the audio stream. It commands the firmware to enable the amplifier, configure the I2S interface and DMA with the correct parameters, and prepare the audio buffer to start receiving data.

**Critical Bug Fix:** The original "hardware won't speak" bug was traced to a `tts:start` message that lacked encoding and sample rate metadata. The firmware was defaulting to an incorrect I2S configuration (e.g., 8000Hz when 16000Hz was required), leading to distorted or silent output. The protocol was updated to make these parameters mandatory.

**Correct `tts:start` Message Example:**
This is the required format. The `stream_id` is used for logging and debugging potential race conditions.

```json
{
  "command": "tts:start",
  "payload": {
    "stream_id": "a7b3c9d1-e2f3-4a5b-8c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d",
    "encoding": "pcm_s16le",
    "sample_rate": 16000,
    "channels": 1
  }
}
```
*   `encoding`: Must be `pcm_s16le` (16-bit signed, little-endian PCM). This is the only format the current hardware DMA supports directly.
*   `sample_rate`: Typically `16000` or `22050`. The firmware uses this value to set the I2S clock dividers.
*   Upon receiving this, the firmware performs:
    1.  Validates the parameters. If invalid, it sends a NACK response and ignores the request.
    2.  Flushes the incoming serial buffer and audio ring buffer.
    3.  Configures the I2S peripheral with the specified sample rate.
    4.  Powers on the external audio amplifier IC via GPIO.
    5.  Enables the DMA channel to transfer data from the audio ring buffer to the I2S `TX_FIFO`.
    6.  Switches its internal state to `AUDIO_STATE_STREAMING`.

#### 5.1.2 Binary Audio Frames

Once the `tts:start` message is acknowledged, the host can begin sending raw audio data.

*   **Format:** Raw, little-endian, 16-bit signed PCM. There are no headers or metadata in these packets.
*   **Transport:** The data is sent directly over the serial (UART) connection.
*   **Buffering:** The firmware uses a FreeRTOS `StreamBuffer` (a thread-safe ring buffer) to ingest the incoming bytes. The audio playback task (`audio_pump_task`) reads from this buffer.
*   **Flow Control:** The serial driver must be robust enough to handle the high-throughput data without drops. If the firmware's ring buffer becomes full, incoming bytes will be discarded, resulting in audio glitches. The host application is responsible for pacing the data transmission to match the playback rate.

#### 5.1.3 The `tts:stop` Control Message

This message explicitly terminates the audio stream. It is **mandatory**. Without it, the amplifier will remain on, and the firmware will be stuck in a streaming state (see VAD fallback below for the safety mechanism).

**Example `tts:stop` Message:**
The `stream_id` should match the one sent in the corresponding `tts:start` for verification.

```json
{
  "command": "tts:stop",
  "payload": {
    "stream_id": "a7b3c9d1-e2f3-4a5b-8c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d"
  }
}
```
*   Upon receiving this, the firmware performs:
    1.  Waits for the audio ring buffer and the DMA buffer to become empty to ensure all sent audio is played.
    2.  Powers off the external audio amplifier IC.
    3.  Disables the I2S peripheral and DMA channel.
    4.  Switches its internal state to `AUDIO_STATE_IDLE`.

### 5.2 VAD Fallback and Safety Timeout

A critical failure mode occurs if the host processor crashes or the connection is lost after a `tts:start` message but before a `tts:stop` is sent. This would leave the firmware's audio system active indefinitely, potentially draining the battery by keeping the amplifier powered on.

To mitigate this, a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) fallback timer was implemented. This is a simple but effective watchdog mechanism.

**Logic:**
1.  The firmware enters the `AUDIO_STATE_STREAMING` state upon a valid `tts:start`.
2.  The `audio_pump_task` continuously pulls data from the audio ring buffer to feed the I2S DMA.
3.  If the `audio_pump_task` attempts to read from the buffer and finds it empty, it starts a software countdown timer.
    *   **`const int VAD_TIMEOUT_MS = 500;`**
4.  If new audio data arrives in the buffer before the timer expires, the timer is reset.
5.  If the timer expires (i.e., no new audio data has been received for 500ms), the firmware assumes the connection is dead and takes unilateral action. It invokes the exact same cleanup procedure as a normal `tts:stop` command.

**Error message logged in this condition:**
`E (34500) audio_pipeline: VAD timed out. No audio frames received for 500ms. Forcing TTS stop.`

This mechanism ensures the hardware cannot get permanently stuck in an active, power-consuming state.

### 5.3 The "Fixed-Beat Loop" for Jitter-Free Playback

The real-time nature of audio requires that we send data to the DAC at a precise, constant rate. Any variation (jitter) in this timing results in audible pops, clicks, or distortion. In an RTOS like FreeRTOS, a naive `vTaskDelay()` loop is insufficient and causes these problems.

**The Problem: The Drifting Loop**
A common but incorrect approach is to delay for a fixed period at the end of a loop.

**Anti-Pattern Code Snippet (Incorrect):**
```cpp
// ANTI-PATTERN: This code creates drift and audio jitter.
void audio_pump_task(void *pvParameters) {
    const int CHUNK_PROCESS_INTERVAL_MS = 20;

    for (;;) {
        // 1. Read a chunk of audio from the ring buffer.
        // 2. Perform any necessary processing.
        // 3. Write the chunk to the I2S DMA.
        //    Let's say this block takes 3ms to execute.

        // This is the error:
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(CHUNK_PROCESS_INTERVAL_MS));
    }
}
```
The total loop time here is `20ms (delay) + 3ms (processing time) = 23ms`. The next loop will also be `23ms`. This cumulative error causes the task to slowly drift, failing to deliver data at the required fixed frequency (in this case, 50Hz). The I2S hardware will eventually run out of data (a buffer underrun), causing an audible pop.

**The Solution: `vTaskDelayUntil()` Fixed-Beat Pattern**
The correct pattern uses `vTaskDelayUntil()`, which allows a task to execute at a fixed frequency with zero cumulative drift. It works by calculating the delay needed to wake up at the *next absolute time*, rather than delaying for a relative period.

**Correct Pattern Code Snippet:**
```cpp
#include "freertos/FreeRTOS.h"
#include "freertos/task.h"

// The task that pulls audio from a buffer and sends it to the I2S hardware.
void audio_pump_task(void *pvParameters) {
    // Defines the frequency of the loop. For a 16000Hz sample rate, we might process
    // 320 samples (640 bytes) per loop, requiring a 20ms period (50Hz).
    const TickType_t xFrequency = pdMS_TO_TICKS(20);
    TickType_t xLastWakeTime;

    // Initialize xLastWakeTime with the current time. This is the starting point.
    xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();

    for (;;) {
        // 1. Block until it's time for the next audio chunk.
        // This function calculates how long to sleep to wake up at exactly
        // xLastWakeTime + xFrequency.
        vTaskDelayUntil(&xLastWakeTime, xFrequency);

        // 2. Read exactly 640 bytes from the audio ring buffer.
        size_t bytes_read = stream_buffer_read(audio_buffer, (void*) i2s_dma_buffer, 640, 0);

        // 3. If we got data, write it to the I2S port.
        // The I2S driver will then use DMA to send it to the DAC.
        if (bytes_read > 0) {
            i2s_write(I2S_PORT, i2s_dma_buffer, bytes_read, &bytes_written, portMAX_DELAY);
        } else {
            // This is where the VAD timeout logic would be triggered.
            handle_vad_timeout();
        }
    }
}
```
By using `vTaskDelayUntil()`, we guarantee that the task executes precisely every `20ms`, regardless of how long the processing within the loop takes (as long as it's less than `20ms`). This provides the I2S peripheral with a steady, jitter-free stream of data, eliminating buffer underruns and producing clean audio.

## Section 6: Backend Resource Management and Dynamic Configuration

The backend is designed for efficiency and resilience, primarily by avoiding the pre-emptive loading of heavy resources. It uses a set of dynamic loading and configuration patterns to minimize startup time and memory footprint, only consuming resources like GPUs and RAM when a specific function is requested.

### The 'Lazy-Loading LLM Cache' Pattern

To manage the significant memory requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs), the system does not load any models into memory on startup. Instead, it uses a lazy-loading pattern coupled with a cache. Access to all LLMs is centralized through the `get_llm_for(purpose)` function.

**Pattern Logic:**

1.  A request is made for an LLM for a specific `purpose` (e.g., `"summarization"`, `"transcription_correction"`).
2.  The `get_llm_for` function first checks an in-memory cache (`_llm_cache`) to see if a model for this purpose has already been instantiated.
3.  **If cached:** The existing model instance is returned immediately.
4.  **If not cached:**
    a. The function consults the main configuration file (`config.yaml`) for an LLM specifically assigned to the requested `purpose`.
    b. **Fallback Mechanism:** If no specific model is configured for the `purpose`, the function falls back to using the configuration for the `"default"` LLM. This ensures system functionality even if a specific purpose is not explicitly configured.
    c. The appropriate LLM client is instantiated using the determined configuration. This is the moment the model is loaded into memory/VRAM, which can be time-consuming.
    d. The newly created instance is stored in the `_llm_cache` with the `purpose` as the key.
    e. The new instance is returned.

**Code Example (`llm_manager.py`):**

```python
from my_llm_library import OllamaClient, GroqClient # Example LLM clients
from config_loader import config # Assume config is loaded globally

# Global cache to hold LLM instances
_llm_cache = {}
_llm_configs = config.get('llms', {})

def get_llm_for(purpose: str):
    """
    Retrieves an LLM instance for a specific purpose, loading it on-demand
    and caching it for future use. Falls back to the 'default' LLM if
    the specific purpose is not configured.
    """
    if purpose in _llm_cache:
        print(f"CACHE HIT: Returning cached LLM for purpose '{purpose}'.")
        return _llm_cache[purpose]

    print(f"CACHE MISS: Instantiating new LLM for purpose '{purpose}'.")

    # Fallback-to-default logic
    llm_config = _llm_configs.get(purpose, _llm_configs.get('default'))

    if not llm_config:
        raise ValueError("LLM configuration error: No configuration found for "
                         f"purpose '{purpose}' and no 'default' LLM is defined.")

    # Instantiate the correct client based on the config
    provider = llm_config.get('provider')
    if provider == 'ollama':
        instance = OllamaClient(model=llm_config['model'])
    elif provider == 'groq':
        instance = GroqClient(model=llm_config['model'], api_key=llm_config['api_key'])
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported LLM provider: {provider}")

    _llm_cache[purpose] = instance
    return instance

# Example Usage:
# summary_llm = get_llm_for("summarization")
# correction_llm = get_llm_for("correction") # This will use the 'default' if not specified
```

**Configuration Example (`config.yaml`):**

```yaml
# LLM configurations. Each purpose can have a specific model.
# If a purpose is requested but not defined, 'default' will be used.
llms:
  default:
    provider: ollama
    model: 'llama3:instruct'
  summarization:
    provider: groq
    model: 'mixtral-8x7b-32768'
    api_key: 'gsk_...YourGroqAPIKey...'
  # Note: 'transcription_correction' is not defined, so it will fall back to 'default'.
```

**Common Error and Solution:**

*   **Error Message:** `ValueError: LLM configuration error: No configuration found for purpose 'summarization' and no 'default' LLM is defined.`
*   **Cause:** The code requested an LLM for a purpose, but neither that purpose nor a `default` entry exists in the `llms` section of `config.yaml`.
*   **Solution:** Ensure your `config.yaml` has a `llms.default` section that points to a valid, working model. This is the primary safety net.

### ASR Instantiation Strategy: Singleton vs. Per-Connection

The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) service is a critical component that can be deployed either locally or consumed from a remote API. The resource management strategy differs significantly between these two modes.

**`LOCAL` ASR (e.g., Whisper): The Singleton Pattern**

*   **Rationale:** Local ASR models are extremely resource-intensive, often requiring gigabytes of VRAM and RAM. Loading the model can take a significant amount of time. It is impractical and often impossible to load a separate instance of the model for each concurrent user or connection.
*   **Strategy:** A singleton pattern is used. The first time a local ASR transcription is requested, the model is loaded into memory and stored in a global instance. All subsequent requests from any connection will use this single, shared instance. This ensures minimal resource overhead and fast processing for subsequent tasks after the initial "cold start."

**`REMOTE` ASR (e.g., Deepgram, AssemblyAI): The Instance-Per-Connection Pattern**

*   **Rationale:** Clients for remote ASR services are lightweight objects. They primarily manage API keys, connection state (like a WebSocket), and request/response streams. This state is specific to a single, continuous transcription session. Sharing a single client instance across multiple independent connections would lead to state collisions, session crosstalk, and authentication issues.
*   **Strategy:** A new client instance is created for every connection. For example, when a new WebSocket connection is established for real-time transcription, a `new RemoteASRClient()` is instantiated. This instance lives only for the duration of that connection and is destroyed when the connection closes, ensuring perfect isolation between sessions.

**Code Example Snippet (conceptual `websocket_handler.py`):**

```python
# ASR manager that handles the singleton for local models
from asr_manager import get_local_asr_instance
# A client for a remote service
from remote_asr_client import RemoteASRClient
from config_loader import config

ASR_TYPE = config.get('asr', {}).get('type', 'LOCAL') # 'LOCAL' or 'REMOTE'

async def on_websocket_connect(websocket):
    """Handles a new client connection."""
    if ASR_TYPE == 'LOCAL':
        # Use the shared, global instance for all connections
        asr_processor = get_local_asr_instance()
    elif ASR_TYPE == 'REMOTE':
        # Create a new, isolated client for this specific connection
        asr_processor = RemoteASRClient(
            api_key=config['asr']['api_key']
        )
    else:
        # Handle error
        return

    # ... proceed with using asr_processor for this websocket's lifetime
```

### Dynamic Configuration Lookup for Device-Specific Settings

The system must often tailor its output for different hardware clients, which may have varying screen sizes or capabilities. Hardcoding these variations is brittle. Instead, a dynamic configuration lookup pattern is used, reading from a dedicated `devices.yaml` file with a safe fallback mechanism.

**Pattern Logic:**

1.  A dedicated `devices.yaml` file stores display and formatting settings for known device IDs.
2.  A `default` section in this file provides fallback settings for any device not explicitly listed.
3.  A helper function, `get_device_setting()`, provides a single point of access for these settings.
4.  The function attempts to find the setting for the specific `device_id` first. If not found, it looks in the `default` section. If still not found, it returns a hardcoded, safe default provided by the calling code.

**Configuration Example (`devices.yaml`):**

This file allows for non-technical users to adjust formatting for new devices without changing any code.

```yaml
# Default settings applicable to any device unless overridden
default:
  lines_per_page: 12
  characters_per_line: 42
  font_size: 'medium'

# Specific override for a high-resolution tablet-style device
'device-hw-id-A7B2':
  lines_per_page: 20
  characters_per_line: 60
  font_size: 'small'

# Specific override for a small, e-ink display
'device-hw-id-C3D9':
  lines_per_page: 8
  characters_per_line: 30
```

**Code Example (`device_config.py`):**

```python
import yaml
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache() # Cache the file read for performance
def _load_device_configs():
    """Loads and parses the devices.yaml file."""
    try:
        with open('devices.yaml', 'r') as f:
            return yaml.safe_load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, yaml.YAMLError) as e:
        print(f"WARNING: Could not load or parse devices.yaml: {e}. Using fallback defaults.")
        return {}

def get_device_setting(device_id: str, key: str, safe_default: any):
    """
    Looks up a setting for a given device_id, falling back to the
    'default' device config, and then to a safe_default.
    """
    configs = _load_device_configs()
    device_specific_configs = configs.get(device_id, {})
    default_configs = configs.get('default', {})

    # 1. Try device-specific setting
    # 2. Try default setting from the file
    # 3. Return the code-provided safe default
    return device_specific_configs.get(key, default_configs.get(key, safe_default))

# Example Usage within the application:
# device_id = current_connection.device_id # e.g., 'device-hw-id-C3D9'
# lines = get_device_setting(device_id, 'lines_per_page', 10) # Returns 8
#
# unknown_device_id = 'device-unlisted-1234'
# lines = get_device_setting(unknown_device_id, 'lines_per_page', 10) # Returns 12 (from default)
#
# # If 'font_weight' is not in the YAML at all:
# weight = get_device_setting(device_id, 'font_weight', 'normal') # Returns 'normal'
```

## Section 7: Key Architectural Decisions and Design Rationale

This document captures the rationale behind key architectural decisions. Its purpose is to provide context for future development and to prevent the re-litigation of settled design choices.

### 1. Disabling `last_render` for Explicit Orchestration

**Initial Behavior (Legacy):**
The system previously included a feature known as `last_render`. This mechanism would automatically re-deliver the assistant's last sent message to a user upon their reconnection.

**Problem Statement:**
This implicit, "magical" auto-redelivery was a significant source of confusion and bugs.
*   **Unpredictable Behavior:** Developers were often unaware of this feature, leading to surprising and unintended conversational flows. A simple reconnection could trigger a message they did not explicitly code for.
*   **Debugging Complexity:** When a message was unexpectedly re-sent, tracing its origin was difficult because the action was initiated by the framework's internal state machine, not by visible application code.
*   **State Management Issues:** It required the framework to maintain state about the "last message sent," adding complexity and potential for race conditions, especially in distributed environments. The application's own state could easily get out of sync with the framework's hidden state.

**Decision & Rationale:**
The `last_render` feature has been intentionally and permanently disabled. We have adopted a core architectural principle favoring **explicit, predictable control over implicit, magical behavior**.

The responsibility for managing conversation state and flow control now resides entirely with the application developer. This shift provides several key advantages:
1.  **Clarity and Predictability:** The application's behavior is now a direct reflection of its code. There are no hidden mechanisms altering the conversation flow.
2.  **Simplified Debugging:** All sent messages can be traced back to an explicit call (`session.send()`, `await send_reply()`, etc.) in the application logic.
3.  **Developer Control:** Developers have full, granular control over the user experience, including how reconnections are handled. They can choose to re-prompt, send a welcome-back message, or do nothing at all.

**Required Action & New Pattern (Developer Workflow):**
Developers must now explicitly handle any desired redelivery logic. The recommended pattern is to use the session state to store context that needs to be revisited.

**Example: Re-prompting a user for a rating after a disconnect.**

```python
# new_handler.py

# Assume 'session' is an object with a 'state' dictionary for storing data.

async def handle_user_message(session, user_input):
    """
    Handles an incoming message from the user.
    """
    if user_input.lower() == 'finish':
        rating_prompt = "Thank you for the chat! How would you rate this conversation from 1 to 5?"
        
        # Store the last question in the session state BEFORE sending it.
        # This ensures that if the user disconnects, we know what we were waiting for.
        session.state['last_question'] = 'rating_prompt'
        await session.send(rating_prompt)
    else:
        # Normal conversation logic
        await session.send("Message received.")


async def handle_reconnection(session):
    """
    Explicitly handles a user's reconnection to the session.
    """
    # Check our own state to see if a specific action is required.
    if session.state.get('last_question') == 'rating_prompt':
        # Re-send the prompt explicitly.
        re_prompt = "Welcome back! We were just asking for your rating (1-5)."
        await session.send(re_prompt)

```

This explicit approach is more verbose but is VASTLY superior in terms of maintainability, predictability, and ease of debugging.

### 2. Standardized Dialogue Summary on Connection Closure

**Problem Statement:**
For logging, monitoring, and operational support, it is critical to know the final state of a conversation when it ends. Without a standardized summary, analyzing logs for conversation outcomes was a manual, time-consuming process of piecing together disparate log entries.

**Decision & Rationale:**
We have implemented an automatic feature that generates and logs a concise, one-line summary of the final dialogue turn whenever a user's connection is closed.

The rationale is to provide an immediate, at-a-glance insight into the conversation's conclusion. By enforcing a strict format, we ensure these summaries are not only human-readable but also easily machine-parsable for automated analysis, metrics dashboards, and alerting.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **Trigger:** This feature is triggered by the event corresponding to the closure of the client's WebSocket connection.
*   **Summary Format:** The log entry is a single string with the following exact format:

    ```
    '{Owner Name}: {User Text} / 喵喵同学: {Assistant Text}'
    ```

*   **Field Descriptions:**
    *   `{Owner Name}`: The identifier of the user who owned the session (e.g., `user-id-12345`). This is pulled from the session context.
    *   `{User Text}`: The raw text of the *last* message received from the user before disconnection.
    *   `喵喵同学`: This is a hardcoded string literal representing the assistant's persona. Using a constant ensures consistency for log parsing.
    *   `{Assistant Text}`: The raw text of the *final* response sent by the assistant.

**Concrete Example:**
Consider a session for a user identified as `user-ava-42`.
1.  User sends their final message: `thanks, that's all`
2.  Assistant sends its final reply: `You're welcome! Have a great day.`
3.  The user closes their browser, terminating the connection.

The system will automatically generate and write the following log entry:

```log
[2023-10-27 10:30:00,123] [INFO] [dialogue_manager] - Dialogue summary: 'user-ava-42: thanks, that's all / 喵喵同学: You're welcome! Have a great day.'
```

This single line provides complete context on the conversation's final turn, proving invaluable for quick operational checks and support inquiries.

## Section 8: Observability, Debugging, and Specific Fixes

This section provides a practical guide for operations, debugging common issues, and documents specific fixes and workarounds that have been implemented. This knowledge is critical for efficient troubleshooting and preventing repeat investigative work.

### 8.1. Logging and Monitoring

Effective debugging starts with understanding the system's log output. Key events and potential errors are tagged for easy filtering and identification.

#### 8.1.1. Message Forwarding Whitelist and `[DROP_BY_MODE]`

To optimize performance and prevent unintended behavior, the system operates in different modes (e.g., `eyes-open`, `eyes-closed`). A message forwarding whitelist dictates which message types are allowed to be processed in a given mode. If a message is received that is not on the whitelist for the current mode, it is discarded, and a log entry with the tag `[DROP_BY_MODE]` is generated.

**Example Log Entry:**

```log
INFO:root:[DROP_BY_MODE] Dropping message 'ui.eyes.toggle' in 'eyes-closed' mode.
```

This log indicates that the `ui.eyes.toggle` message was received while the system was in `eyes-closed` mode. According to the whitelist, this message is not processed in this mode, so it was intentionally dropped.

**Message Forwarding Whitelist Reference Table:**

| Message Type              | Allowed in `eyes-open` Mode | Allowed in `eyes-closed` Mode | Notes                                                               |
| ------------------------- | :-------------------------: | :---------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listen.start`            |              ✅             |               ✅              | Core user interaction to begin listening.                           |
| `listen.stop`             |              ✅             |               ✅              | Core user interaction to stop listening.                            |
| `audio.in.chunk`          |              ✅             |               ✅              | Raw audio data stream.                                              |
| `wakeword.detected`       |              ✅             |               ✅              | Signals that the wakeword was spoken.                               |
| `conversation.new_turn`   |              ✅             |               ✅              | A new entry was added to the conversation history.                  |
| `camera.capture_frame`    |              ✅             |               ❌              | Dropped in `eyes-closed` to save resources.                         |
| `vision.describe_frame`   |              ✅             |               ❌              | Vision processing is disabled in `eyes-closed` mode.                |
| `ui.eyes.toggle`          |              ✅             |               ❌              | UI control to toggle eye animations; irrelevant in `eyes-closed`. |
| `system.error`            |              ✅             |               ✅              | Critical errors must always be processed.                           |

#### 8.1.2. Audio Pipeline Performance

To debug issues with audio processing, such as delays or dropouts, the audio pipeline outputs a debug-level log for every processed chunk. This log provides key metrics on the amount of data being handled.

**To enable this log, set the logging level to `DEBUG`.**

**Example Log Entry:**

```log
DEBUG:root:[Audio Pipeline] Processed audio chunk. frames=480, bytes_total=960
```

*   **`frames`**: The number of audio frames in the processed chunk. In this example, `480` frames.
*   **`bytes_total`**: The total size of the chunk in bytes. In this example, `960` bytes (480 frames * 2 bytes/frame for 16-bit audio).

Monitoring these values can help identify inconsistencies in the audio stream from the microphone.

### 8.2. Specific Fixes and Known Workarounds

This section documents fixes for specific, non-obvious issues that have been resolved.

#### 8.2.1. UI Event Debouncing for `listen.start`

**Problem:** Users rapidly clicking the "Listen" button on the UI could fire multiple `listen.start` events in quick succession, causing the system to erratically start and stop the listening state.

**Solution:** The `listen.start` event listener on the UI is debounced with a **300ms** timer.

**Behavior:** When the `listen.start` event is fired, the system will wait 300ms before processing it. Any subsequent `listen.start` events that arrive within this 300ms window are ignored. This ensures that only the first intended click is registered, providing a stable user experience.

#### 8.2.2. UI Formatting Fix: Bullet Point in Conversation History

**Problem:** A previous version of the UI component responsible for displaying conversation history would prepend a bullet point character (`• `) to user-submitted text. This character was being unintentionally saved into the raw conversation logs and sent to the backend, potentially causing parsing or display issues in other contexts.

**Solution:** A sanitization function was added to the message handling logic. It explicitly checks for and removes the `• ` prefix from any incoming conversation strings before they are processed or persisted.

**Example:**

*   **Incorrect Input:** `"• Hello, how are you?"`
*   **After Sanitization:** `"Hello, how are you?"`

This is a historical fix, but it's important to be aware of in case older, unsanitized data is ever encountered.

#### 8.2.3. Pydantic Validator Pylint False Alarm (`variable v`)

**Problem:** During the migration to Pydantic v2, a common Pylint `invalid-name` false positive was encountered. Pydantic's documentation and common usage patterns for field validators use the single-letter variable `v` to represent the value being validated. Pylint, by default, flags this as a non-descriptive variable name.

**Example Pydantic Validator Causing the Error:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str

    @field_validator("username")
    @classmethod
    def validate_username(cls, v: str) -> str:  # Pylint flags 'v' here
        if len(v) < 3:
            raise ValueError("Username must be at least 3 characters long")
        return v
```

**Pylint Error Message:**

```
C0103: Variable name "v" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)
```

**Resolution:** To prevent developers from wasting time "fixing" this idiomatic code, the `.pylintrc` file was updated to explicitly allow `v` as a "good name". This acknowledges it as a standard variable in the context of Pydantic validators.

**Fix in `.pylintrc`:**

Under the `[VARIABLES]` or `[BASIC]` section, add `v` to the `good-names` list.

```ini
# .pylintrc

[VARIABLES]
# Good variable names which should be ignored by the C0103 check
good-names=i,j,k,ex,Run,_,v
```

This configuration permanently resolves the false alarm across the project.
