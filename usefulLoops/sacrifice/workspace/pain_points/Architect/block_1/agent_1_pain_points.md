# Pain Points Extraction: Architect Block 1

**Note:** This block contains a system prompt/role definition rather than an actual conversation with technical implementation details. The following are potential challenges and limitations identified from the prompt structure:

## Issue: File Access Limitation
The system cannot access files referenced with `@` symbols, which limits the architect's ability to analyze actual codebases.

**Solution:**
The prompt explicitly requires declaring this limitation and requesting alternative materials from users when `@` references cannot be accessed.

---

## Issue: Missing Quantifiable Success Criteria
Business requirements often lack specific metrics and success criteria, making architecture decisions difficult to validate.

**Solution:**
The prompt includes clarification questions to gather "量化标准" (quantifiable standards) such as latency requirements (<200ms) and cost reduction targets (30%).

---

## Issue: Information Verification Challenge
Technical decisions require verifiable sources, but many architectural recommendations may be based on best practices without specific citations.

**Solution:**
The prompt mandates marking unverifiable information as 'source required' and maintaining a Citations section to track information gaps.

---

## Issue: Complexity vs. Business Value Balance
Over-engineering is a common problem in architecture design, leading to unnecessary complexity.

**Solution:**
The prompt emphasizes the 80/20 principle - focusing on solving the critical 20% of problems that address 80% of needs, with "长期业务价值" (long-term business value) as the highest criterion.

---

## Issue: Communication Gap Between Technical and Business Stakeholders
Architecture discussions often fail because technical depth and business impact are not properly balanced for mixed audiences.

**Solution:**
The prompt requires explanations that "高中生能听懂" (high school students can understand) while maintaining technical precision, targeting mixed teams of technical leads, architects, and product managers.

**Analysis Summary:**
This block represents a system design for an AI architect assistant rather than actual implementation pain points. The prompt itself acknowledges common architectural consulting challenges and builds solutions into the AI's behavior pattern.
