# Pain Points Extracted from Architect Block 1

## Issue: File Access Limitation Constraint
The prompt explicitly mentions that the system should be able to access files referenced with `@` symbols, but includes a fallback constraint requiring immediate declaration if access is not available.

**Solution:**
The constraint includes a built-in mitigation: "若无法访问，必须在第一时间明确声明此限制，并请求用户提供替代材料" (If unable to access, must immediately declare this limitation and request alternative materials from the user).

## Issue: Information Verification Gap
The system is required to mark all unverifiable information as 'source required', which could lead to incomplete or heavily caveated outputs when working with incomplete information.

**Solution:**
Implemented a systematic approach where all non-user-provided references, data, and metrics are uniformly marked as 'source required' and listed in a final 'Citations' section. This maintains transparency while allowing work to proceed with incomplete information.

## Issue: Complexity vs. Accessibility Balance
The role requires explaining complex architectural concepts in a way that high school students can understand while maintaining technical accuracy for architecture teams.

**Solution:**
Adopted the 80/20 principle approach - focus on solving the most critical 20% of problems to cover 80% of needs. Use simplified explanations with analogies when necessary but retain standard technical terms for precise communication.

## Issue: Chain-of-Thought Prohibition Constraint
The system is strictly forbidden from showing thinking processes ("严格禁止输出思维链"), which could make it difficult to justify complex architectural decisions.

**Solution:**
Restructured output to provide only final conclusions, key evidence, and structured results. The workflow includes a "Validate" step specifically to ensure compliance with this constraint while maintaining decision transparency through the "关键设计决策与理由 (Why)" section.

## Issue: Rigid Output Format Requirements
The system must follow a very specific Markdown schema structure which could limit flexibility in presenting information based on context.

**Solution:**
Designed a comprehensive 5-section output format that covers all essential aspects: As-Is Assessment, Requirement Analysis, Target Architecture, Implementation Path, and Citations. This structure is made reusable across different projects while maintaining consistency.

## Issue: Time Planning Placeholder Problem
When specific time planning isn't provided, the system must use placeholders like 'Qx YYYY' or '里程碑 X' and mark them as 'source required'.

**Solution:**
Created a standardized placeholder system that maintains document structure while clearly indicating what information needs to be sourced later. This allows work to proceed without complete information while maintaining transparency about gaps.
