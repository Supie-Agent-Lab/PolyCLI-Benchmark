# Comprehensive Pain Points: Architect Block 1

**Executive Summary:**
This block contains a system prompt/role definition rather than actual architectural implementation. The pain points identified are primarily workflow and constraint limitations rather than technical debugging issues. The following represents consolidated insights from all three agent analyses.

---

## Critical Issues (High Severity)

### Issue: File Access System Limitation
**Description:** The system cannot access files referenced with `@` symbols (like `@index.md`, `@log.md`), which fundamentally limits the architect's ability to analyze actual codebases and provide contextual recommendations.

**Impact:** 
- Architects cannot perform thorough codebase analysis
- Recommendations may be generic rather than project-specific
- Users must manually provide file contents as alternative materials

**Solution:**
The prompt includes built-in mitigation requiring immediate declaration of this limitation: "若无法访问，必须在第一时间明确声明此限制，并请求用户提供替代材料" (If unable to access, must immediately declare this limitation and request alternative materials from the user).

### Issue: Information Verification Challenge vs. Chain-of-Thought Prohibition
**Description:** Complex architectural decisions require transparent reasoning, but the system is "严格禁止输出思维链" (strictly forbidden from showing thinking processes). Simultaneously, all unverifiable information must be marked as 'source required'.

**Impact:**
- Decision justification becomes opaque
- Heavy caveating of outputs when working with incomplete information
- Difficulty building trust in architectural recommendations

**Solution:**
- Restructured output to provide final conclusions with key evidence in structured results
- Implemented systematic marking of all non-user-provided references as 'source required'
- Added dedicated "关键设计决策与理由 (Why)" section for decision transparency
- Maintained Citations section to track information gaps

## Major Issues (Medium-High Severity)

### Issue: Incomplete Implementation Context
**Description:** The conversation block contains only system setup without actual user-architect interaction, making it impossible to identify real-world technical pain points.

**Impact:**
- No executable content to extract meaningful pain points from
- Gap between comprehensive workflow definition and practical execution
- Missing "actually" moments where initial approaches were corrected

**Expected Real-World Scenarios:**
- Actual user requirements and architect responses
- Implementation attempts and failures
- Debugging sessions and performance optimization discussions
- Integration challenges and solutions
- Migration strategies encountering unexpected obstacles

---

### Issue: Missing Quantifiable Success Criteria
**Description:** Business requirements often lack specific metrics and success criteria, making architecture decisions difficult to validate against measurable outcomes.

**Impact:**
- Decisions cannot be objectively evaluated
- ROI of architectural choices remains unclear
- Risk of over-engineering without clear value metrics

**Solution:**
The prompt includes clarification questions to gather "量化标准" (quantifiable standards) such as:
- Latency requirements (<200ms)
- Cost reduction targets (30%)
- Performance benchmarks
- Scalability thresholds

---

## Moderate Issues (Medium Severity)

### Issue: Complexity vs. Accessibility Balance
**Description:** The role requires explaining complex architectural concepts in a way that "高中生能听懂" (high school students can understand) while maintaining technical accuracy for mixed audiences of technical leads, architects, and product managers.

**Impact:**
- Risk of oversimplification losing technical precision
- Difficulty serving both technical and business stakeholders
- Communication gaps between technical depth and business impact

**Solution:**
- Adopted 80/20 principle approach - focus on solving the most critical 20% of problems to cover 80% of needs
- Use simplified explanations with analogies when necessary
- Retain standard technical terms for precise communication
- Emphasize "长期业务价值" (long-term business value) as the highest criterion

---

### Issue: Rigid Output Format Requirements
**Description:** The system must follow a very specific Markdown schema structure which could limit flexibility in presenting information based on varying project contexts and requirements.

**Impact:**
- Reduced adaptability to different project types
- Potential mismatch between required format and optimal information presentation
- Constraint on contextual communication

**Solution:**
Designed a comprehensive 5-section output format covering all essential aspects:
1. As-Is Assessment
2. Requirement Analysis
3. Target Architecture
4. Implementation Path
5. Citations

This structure maintains consistency while being reusable across different projects.

## Minor Issues (Low Severity)

### Issue: Time Planning Placeholder Problem
**Description:** When specific time planning isn't provided, the system must use placeholders like 'Qx YYYY' or '里程碑 X' and mark them as 'source required'.

**Impact:**
- Documents appear incomplete with placeholder values
- Additional coordination required to fill timing gaps
- Workflow interrupted by missing temporal information

**Solution:**
Created a standardized placeholder system that:
- Maintains document structure integrity
- Clearly indicates what information needs to be sourced later
- Allows work to proceed without complete information
- Maintains transparency about information gaps

---

## Consolidated Analysis Summary

**Primary Pattern:** This block represents theoretical framework definition rather than practical implementation, revealing a documentation vs. execution gap common in complex systems.

**Key Insight:** The theoretical workflow is well-defined with detailed checklists, but actual pain points would only emerge during real usage scenarios involving:
- Users providing incomplete requirements
- File access failures during analysis
- Time constraints conflicting with thorough analysis
- Business and technical priorities clashing
- Migration strategies encountering unexpected obstacles

**Recommendation:** Future blocks should capture actual user-architect interactions to identify concrete technical challenges and debugging scenarios for more actionable pain point extraction.
