# Architect Block 1 Pain Points

## Issue: Incomplete conversation block - System setup without actual interaction
The conversation block contains only the system prompt and role definition without any actual user-architect interaction where problems could occur.

**Solution:**
This appears to be the initial system configuration for an architect role. No technical pain points, debugging issues, or "actually" moments are present since no actual conversation or implementation took place. The content is purely a role definition and workflow specification.

## Issue: No executable content to extract pain points from
The block consists entirely of role instructions, workflow definitions, and output format specifications without any practical implementation or problem-solving scenarios.

**Solution:**
To extract meaningful pain points, we would need conversation blocks that contain:
- Actual user requirements and architect responses
- Implementation attempts and failures
- Debugging sessions
- Performance optimization discussions
- Integration challenges and solutions
- "Actually" moments where initial approaches were corrected

## Issue: Missing @-referenced files mentioned in constraints
The system prompt references the ability to access files via `@` symbols (like `@index.md`, `@log.md`) but no such files are actually referenced or accessed in this conversation block.

**Solution:**
The constraint states: "如果因环境限制无法访问`@`引用的文件，必须首先声明该问题，暂停给出深度结论，并等待用户提供信息" (If environment limitations prevent access to `@` referenced files, must first declare the problem, pause deep conclusions, and wait for user to provide information). This indicates a potential workflow issue that would need to be addressed in actual implementation.

## Issue: Gap between comprehensive workflow definition and practical execution
The role defines a 5-step workflow (Analyze, Diagnose, Reconstruct, Validate, Plan) with detailed checklists, but no actual execution of this workflow is demonstrated.

**Solution:**
This represents a documentation vs. implementation gap that's common in complex systems. The theoretical framework is well-defined, but practical pain points would only emerge during actual usage when:
- Users provide incomplete requirements
- File access fails
- Time constraints conflict with thorough analysis
- Business and technical priorities clash
- Migration strategies encounter unexpected obstacles
