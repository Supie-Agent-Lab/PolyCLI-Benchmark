# Pain Points from Backend Block 1 Conversation

## Issue: NameError due to variables incorrectly placed in __init__ method
The conversation block shows a critical error where variables were mistakenly added to the __init__ method, causing NameError when they were accessed later.

**Solution:**
Moved the variables initialization from `__init__` to the proper location within connection.py. This fixed the immediate runtime error preventing the backend from functioning.

## Issue: Hardware device not receiving TTS audio - "硬件不会说话"
Critical issue where the hardware device was not speaking. The backend was not sending TTS (Text-to-Speech) start status to the hardware device, preventing audio playback.

**Solution:**
Restored the "tts start" status message that needs to be sent to hardware when TTS begins. This ensures the hardware device knows when to expect and play audio data.

## Issue: AttributeError when websocket doesn't have send_json method
When trying to send JSON data via websocket, the code encountered AttributeError because the websocket object didn't have a send_json method.

**Solution:**
Added fallback handling to manually serialize JSON when send_json is not available:
```python
try:
    await self.websocket.send_json(payload)
except AttributeError:
    import json as _json
    await self.websocket.send(_json.dumps(payload, ensure_ascii=False))
```

## Issue: TypeError when shutting down executor with cancel_futures parameter
Python version compatibility issue where older Python versions don't support the `cancel_futures` parameter in executor.shutdown().

**Solution:**
Added version-aware shutdown handling:
```python
try:
    # Python 3.9+ supports cancel_futures
    self.executor.shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)
except TypeError:
    self.executor.shutdown(wait=False)
```

## Issue: WebSocket connection closed exceptions during send operations
Multiple instances of connection closed errors when trying to send messages, causing unhandled exceptions.

**Solution:**
Added proper exception handling to gracefully handle closed connections:
```python
except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
    # Connection closed, handle silently
    self.logger.bind(tag=TAG).debug(f"send_json: connection closed for device {self.device_id}")
    return False
```

## Issue: VAD (Voice Activity Detection) fallback timing issues
The VAD system needed a fallback mechanism when device boundaries weren't detected within expected timeframes.

**Solution:**
Implemented VAD fallback trigger based on timing:
```python
if last_event_ms > 0 and (now_ms - last_event_ms) > fallback_ms:
    self.logger.bind(tag=TAG).debug(f"VAD兜底触发: {now_ms - last_event_ms}ms未见设备边界")
    return True
```

---

## Issue: Missing error handling for various Exception types
Generic exception handling was missing in multiple places, causing potential crashes.

**Solution:**
Added comprehensive exception handling throughout the code with appropriate logging:
```python
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.bind(tag=TAG).warning(f"send_text failed for device {self.device_id}: {e}")
    return False
```

## Issue: Queue clearing not properly managing TTS and audio queues
Queue management during cleanup was not properly handling TTS text and audio queues.

**Solution:**
Implemented proper queue clearing with logging to track cleanup progress:
```python
self.logger.bind(tag=TAG).debug(
    f"开始清理: TTS队列大小={self.tts.tts_text_queue.qsize()}, 音频队列大小={self.tts.tts_audio_queue.qsize()}"
)
```

---

## Issue: Authentication and device binding exceptions not properly imported
Missing imports for authentication and device management exceptions.

**Solution:**
Added proper imports:
```python
from core.auth import AuthMiddleware, AuthenticationError
from config.manage_api_client import DeviceNotFoundException, DeviceBindException
```

---

## Issue: Listen state transitions not properly managed
State machine for listening states (idle -> listening -> finalizing -> idle) was not properly transitioning.

**Solution:**
Implemented proper state transition logic with debug logging:
```python
if old_state == "idle" and new_state == "listening":
    self.listen_state = "listening"
    self._last_listen_event_ms = int(time.time() * 1000)
    self.logger.bind(tag=TAG).debug("Listen state: idle -> listening")
```

---

## Issue: MCP tool calls not properly logged and handled
MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calls were not being properly logged for debugging.

**Solution:**
Added detailed debug logging for MCP tool calls:
```python
self.logger.bind(tag=TAG).debug(
    f"调用小智端MCP工具: {function_name}, 参数: {function_arguments}"
)
self.logger.bind(tag=TAG).debug(f"MCP工具调用结果: {result}")
```

## Issue: Report thread configuration comments unclear
Configuration for ASR and TTS reporting wasn't clear about future modifications.

**Solution:**
Added clarifying comment:
```python
# 未来可以通过修改此处，调节asr的上报和tts的上报，目前默认都开启
self.report_asr_enable = self.read_config_from_api
self.report_tts_enable = self.read_config_from_api
```
