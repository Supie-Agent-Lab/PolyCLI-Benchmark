# Pain Points Analysis - Backend Block 1

## Summary
No pain points were identified in this block. The block contains only the initial requirements and task specification for implementing backend features for EinkRenderEngine, but does not include any actual implementation, debugging, or problem-solving content.

## Content Overview
The block contains:
- Role definition for "AetherCode" (a world-class full-stack engineer persona)
- Core principles for code quality and solution design
- Project requirements for implementing:
  - Device message routing (`ui.render` and `device.control`)
  - Last render cache functionality
  - Message forwarding with hot-fix approach
  - Rate limiting and caching
  - Device mapping injection from YAML configuration
  - Logging updates

## Status
This appears to be an incomplete conversation block that was cut off before the actual implementation response was provided. No issues, solutions, or debugging activities were documented.
