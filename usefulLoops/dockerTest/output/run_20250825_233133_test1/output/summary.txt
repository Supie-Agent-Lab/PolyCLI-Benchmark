The premise oversimplifies human attraction. People aren't attracted to entire gender categories but to individuals with specific qualities. Attraction involves a complex mix of physical traits, personality, shared values, and chemistry that varies greatly between individuals.

The logic also assumes people should become what they're attracted to, which doesn't follow. We're often drawn to complementary qualities rather than identical ones. Someone organized might appreciate a spontaneous partner; someone emotional might value a calm presence.

Most importantly, "masculine" and "feminine" are cultural constructs that vary across societies and time periods. Real people embody mixtures of traits regardless of gender, and healthy relationships typically involve partners who can be both strong and vulnerable, logical and emotional, depending on the situation.
