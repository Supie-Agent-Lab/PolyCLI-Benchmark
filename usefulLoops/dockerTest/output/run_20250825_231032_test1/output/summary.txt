This statement contains a logical fallacy. The premise "if men love women, women love men" doesn't lead to the conclusion about adopting each other's traditionally associated traits or movements.

The argument incorrectly assumes that loving someone means adopting their characteristics or advocating for their specific interests. By this flawed logic, loving someone would mean becoming like them, which isn't how love or advocacy works.

Feminism is about gender equality, not exclusively for or about women. Anyone can be feminist regardless of gender. Similarly, masculinity and femininity are traits that exist across all genders in various combinations.

The statement confuses romantic attraction with identity adoption and misunderstands what feminism represents.
