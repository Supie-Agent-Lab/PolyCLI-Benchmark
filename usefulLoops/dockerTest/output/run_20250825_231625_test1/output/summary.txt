This statement presents a circular paradox about gender attraction and identity. The logic suggests that if attraction exists between opposites, then to maximize attractiveness, each gender should embody more of what the other desires - creating an impossible loop where men would become increasingly feminine to attract women, while women would become increasingly masculine to attract men, ultimately reversing or eliminating the very distinctions that supposedly create the attraction in the first place.

The paradox highlights the oversimplification in assuming attraction is based solely on oppositeness or that people should transform themselves entirely to match what they think others want.
