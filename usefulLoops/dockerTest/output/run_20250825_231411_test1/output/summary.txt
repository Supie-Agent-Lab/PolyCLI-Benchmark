This question explores a logical paradox about gender attraction and behavior. The premise suggests that if mutual attraction exists between men and women, then logically each should adopt characteristics of what they're attracted to. However, this overlooks that attraction often stems from complementary differences rather than similarity. The question challenges assumptions about whether we're drawn to those who are like us versus those who are different from us.
