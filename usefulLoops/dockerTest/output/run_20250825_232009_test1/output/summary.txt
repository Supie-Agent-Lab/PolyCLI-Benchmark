The premise oversimplifies attraction. People aren't attracted to pure opposites - they're attracted to individuals with varying combinations of traits. The idea that "men love women" and "women love men" as monolithic categories misses that attraction is highly personal and multifaceted.

Additionally, trying to become what you think someone else wants often backfires. Authenticity tends to be more attractive than performative behavior. The paradox assumes a kind of optimization game that doesn't reflect how human relationships actually work - they're built on genuine connection, shared values, and complementary (not opposite) qualities.

The statement's logic would lead to everyone converging on some androgynous middle ground, which clearly doesn't happen in reality, suggesting the initial assumptions are flawed.
